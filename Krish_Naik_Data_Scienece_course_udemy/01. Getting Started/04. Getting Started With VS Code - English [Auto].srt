1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:05,930
So guys, in our previous video we have already seen that how you can proceed and download the entire

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,100
Anaconda distribution.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,540
Along with that, do the installation.

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,880
And we have already done that in our previous video.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,220
And we could also see that I've also spoken about the IDE that we are going to use like Jupyter Notebook,

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,570
Jupyter Lab, and VS code.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,060
So uh, and uh, I'd also shown you how you can launch the VS code just by using the command that is

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,810
code Dot.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,830
Now in this video, uh, if you remember, like I've already given this entire course materials inside

10
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:36,050
this GitHub link and in this video, what I'm actually going to do is that I'm going to show you how

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,070
you can start with this particular course materials and how you can start practicing.

12
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,980
Uh, there are two things that I'm going to discuss over here.

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,610
Is that using VS code, how we can create an environment, uh, which is important because whenever

14
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:55,250
we work with any data science project, it is necessary that we really need to create a specific environment

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:00,620
so that whatever are the packages that is compatible to that particular environment, only that part

16
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,910
only will be installing.

17
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:08,570
So, um, so this, uh, entire is the repository what you can actually do, you can fork the repository

18
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,260
or you can also download the zip if you want to directly do it.

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,740
Okay.

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:17,060
So let's say that this is my this is my entire code file okay.

21
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:21,050
And from here what I'm actually going to do is that I'm going to start my VS code.

22
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:26,060
So I'll go ahead and right click over here and just open with VS code.

23
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,290
Open with code over here.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,550
Once I do this then what it is going to do it is going to make this complete machine learning folder

25
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,830
as a project, and it is going to open this.

26
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,520
Okay.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,850
And one more thing that I forgot to tell you is that this Jupyter notebook will also be available in

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,450
the VS code.

29
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,980
So that is the reason why I'm focusing on showing you how you can start with VS code itself, right?

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,730
So you don't have to have a different dependency in all this particular tools.

31
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,400
So uh, let's say that this is my entire code materials and obviously how you can download it.

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,040
You can just go over here and download this particular zip file.

33
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,040
Uh, this link is already given in the course, uh, Udemy course itself in probably in the second section.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,820
And uh, all you have to do is that in order to open it, just go ahead, right click and press open

35
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,660
with code right.

36
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,400
Or click on open with code.

37
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,010
And this is your entire code materials that is there.

38
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,620
And whenever you go with respect to any materials, if there is no PDF file, let's say there is a logistic

39
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,870
regression over here and there is practical.

40
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,050
So if I open this, you'll be able to see that the entire Jupyter notebook gets opened here itself.

41
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,560
Okay.

42
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,960
So uh, this entire code material can open it like this and you can start practicing it.

43
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:40,700
If you are starting from basics, uh, then what you can do is that you can create another folder.

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,060
Let's say I go over here, I open my command prompt.

45
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,570
Okay.

46
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,290
Sorry.

47
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,610
I go over here.

48
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,930
I open my command prompt.

49
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:51,200
Now inside the command prompt, let's say E is my location.

50
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,760
I write CD code.

51
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,030
Okay.

52
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,890
Code is one folder that I have created.

53
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,150
And let's say that I want to start my coding from this specific folder itself.

54
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,330
Right.

55
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,100
So I will go ahead and write code dot.

56
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,030
So two ways.

57
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,920
One is just right click from the folder location and go ahead and click on open with code.

58
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,020
Otherwise go to that particular uh folder location or write code dot okay.

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,290
So once I write this so here is your entire VS code okay.

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,440
And here you can probably see that I have not started anything.

61
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,880
So this is completely empty.

62
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,400
And this is uh where you have the entire code.

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:22,850
Okay.

64
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,350
Uh, so let me first of all start with this empty file, uh, empty project.

65
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:27,770
Okay.

66
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,360
To proceed with the first step is that I will go ahead and create an environment.

67
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:32,630
Okay.

68
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,910
So let me just go ahead and open command prompt.

69
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:39,590
So in this uh, vs code you have different different terminals like PowerShell, git bash, command

70
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,570
prompt, git bash and PowerShell gives you an experience with respect to running the commands in a Linux

71
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,350
environment.

72
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,850
But since I'm going to focus more on the windows, uh, I will go ahead and click on Command Prompt.

73
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,440
Now over here, you'll be able to see that the first step that we are probably going to do, and this

74
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:00,200
is a complete empty repository, as I always as I already showed you now with respect to this particular

75
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,970
empty repository, what I'm actually going to do is that, first of all, I'm going to create an environment

76
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,220
for any projects that you probably work.

77
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,320
It is always a good practice that you create a separate environment so that you can segregate the packages,

78
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,080
the libraries, in a very easy way with respect to the further updates that are probably coming in that

79
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,010
those packages.

80
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,270
So in order to create an environment, if you have already installed Anaconda, we are going to use

81
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,990
conda package.

82
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,370
So it will be conda create minus p okay v and v.

83
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:30,440
This is my environment name.

84
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,690
And here I'm going to use my Python version.

85
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:36,950
Let's say the Python version that I'm going to use is 3.10 right now.

86
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:43,070
Um, you uh, if I probably say right now the recent version of Python is 3.12.

87
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,470
But, uh, with respect to the entire code that we are going to see in this particular course, everything

88
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,820
will be, uh, executable with the help of 3.10 library.

89
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,270
Okay.

90
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:56,900
So this is the first thing I will go ahead and install this.

91
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,840
Uh, so what it is going to do is that it is going to create a.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,900
New environment.

93
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,700
Okay, now it is asking me.

94
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,230
Go ahead and proceed with the installation of the new environment or creation of the new environment.

95
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,260
So here you will be able to see my V and V environment is created.

96
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,560
So this is the default environment I will be using for executing my entire course materials.

97
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:16,980
Okay.

98
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,030
So let's say that I'm going to go ahead with linear regression or logistic regression.

99
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,980
I'll be using this specific environment.

100
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,830
I will be starting this now.

101
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:31,410
Uh one more thing that I really want to talk about is requirements dot txt okay.

102
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,220
And uh what is this requirement dot txt.

103
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,390
Now see understand one thing guys uh, if you probably consider this entire course right we are going

104
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,060
to use pip install.

105
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,820
Let's say I go ahead and write pip install sklearn.

106
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,270
So we are going to use this library a lot okay.

107
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,520
Scikit learn this package a lot.

108
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,800
If you want to install this particular library all you have to do is that either you can directly go

109
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,610
ahead and uh, install it in the Jupyter notebook, or a better way is that, uh, I will probably copy

110
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:05,970
this.

111
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,540
Okay.

112
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,790
I will go to my requirement dot txt and let's say I go ahead and write sklearn over here.

113
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,710
So sklearn is the library that I'm going to use.

114
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,390
Sorry it should be scikit learn.

115
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,100
So I will copy this okay.

116
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,340
And let's say I'm pasting it over here okay.

117
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,970
So this is the common library that we are going to use in our machine learning course itself.

118
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:24,420
Right.

119
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,480
And in NLP we will be installing some other libraries and all.

120
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,960
Okay.

121
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,930
Now let's say this scikit learn is basically there, right.

122
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:38,070
Uh, any packages that I'm going to use in this specific course I can go ahead and write in this requirement

123
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,650
dot txt and I can install this.

124
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,180
So first of all what I need to do over here, since I have already created my environment, I will go

125
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,130
ahead and activate that environment.

126
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,770
Let's say in order to activate it I will write Conda activate and that particular folder location that

127
00:06:52,770 --> 00:07:00,180
is v and V right now as soon as you write this command, this basically means that this V and V environment

128
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,710
has got activated.

129
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:08,100
Now for the installation of any packages will basically get installed in this package in this environment.

130
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,890
So now if I go want to probably go ahead and install pip install scikit learn okay.

131
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:18,900
Then I will go ahead and pip install minus r requirement dot txt because there is this requirement dot

132
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,390
txt has this scikit learn package.

133
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:21,810
Okay.

134
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,090
So once I probably execute this here you will be able to see that this installation will happen.

135
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,780
So further going ahead any packages that you require let's say I want uh NLTK package and all I can

136
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,360
keep on writing over here, I can keep on installing and I will use this same environment to execute

137
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,170
any files.

138
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,620
Okay.

139
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,040
Now this is, uh, just a basic information of just making you understand how to create a environment,

140
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,930
how to activate an environment.

141
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,300
Now, the next thing that I'm actually going to do, I will go ahead and open a command prompt.

142
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:54,750
Okay.

143
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,420
Now see if I want to create any file.

144
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,680
Let's say I want to work with uh, linear regression okay.

145
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,550
And let's say I want the two types of file that we specifically consider.

146
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,510
Or we basically use uh, whenever we are creating a project.

147
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,130
One is ipynb.

148
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,640
Okay.

149
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,690
So this is one file Ipynb file that we specifically use.

150
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,360
Uh, this is also called as a Jupyter notebook file.

151
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,730
And the other file is basically the py file.

152
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,430
So let's say that I go ahead and write test.py file.

153
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,170
So with respect to test.py you can go ahead and write any code like this.

154
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,850
Like import pandas, import numpy as NP.

155
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,270
Whatever thing you specifically want to write, you can go ahead and write it okay.

156
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,950
And you can start writing your code.

157
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:47,520
And in order to execute it, let's say that I go ahead and write print what is one plus one okay.

158
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,440
One plus one okay.

159
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,190
And I know that this pandas and numpy is already present in my venv.

160
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,320
In order to execute this test.py, I will go ahead and write python test.py.

161
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,350
Okay, so here you can see no module in pandas.

162
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,610
Okay, let me do one thing.

163
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,980
Since pandas is not installed uh, in V and v, I will just go ahead and execute this right now.

164
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,300
If this is not installed, all you can do is that if you want to use pandas, I will go ahead and copy

165
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:12,750
this.

166
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:18,390
I will paste it over here okay I will go ahead and write again pip install minus r requirement dot txt.

167
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,210
Then automatically this pandas will also get installed.

168
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:27,000
But just to run this test.py you need to just write python test.py.

169
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,520
Now you see I am getting the output as two.

170
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,740
Okay, now this is one way, okay?

171
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,010
The other way is just by using this Jupyter notebook file.

172
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,500
Okay, now if you want to run Jupyter notebook file in your VS code okay.

173
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,230
So there are two packages which you need to install.

174
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:43,410
Okay.

175
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,240
And this is really much compulsory.

176
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,030
The first thing is that I will go ahead and write pip install I pi kernel okay.

177
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,520
This is a package which will be responsible in providing a specific kernel to a Jupyter notebook file.

178
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:56,850
Okay.

179
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,460
So if I go ahead and write pip install ipykernel I will.

180
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,020
Go ahead and press enter.

181
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,740
Okay.

182
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,620
Let's say if I'm going to execute this right now.

183
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,040
Okay.

184
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,230
Now see what is the error we will get.

185
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:07,770
Okay.

186
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,760
It will be detecting the kernels and it will it will not execute in short.

187
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,030
So for a Jupyter notebook file I need to definitely install Ipykernel first of all right.

188
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,450
So this is what I really require Ipykernel.

189
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,270
So that Ipykernel will get executed over here.

190
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:29,970
And uh, it will probably take some amount of time based on your internet speed and all.

191
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,510
Okay.

192
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,270
Now once I probably go ahead and install this Ipykernel, I will go ahead and click on this detecting

193
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:40,200
kernels and I will select the Python environment which have created locally.

194
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,780
So here you can see I have this Python 3.10 as my uh environment variable.

195
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,260
Okay.

196
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,840
Now let me just go ahead and run this one.

197
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,070
Plus before it was not running.

198
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:55,680
Now you can see now you can start running any code inside this ipynb file.

199
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,320
Now the next thing is that if you don't if you're not comfortable in providing packages in requirements.txt,

200
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,570
you can also do the installation over here directly.

201
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,720
Let's say that I want to go ahead with, uh, pandas.

202
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,300
So I'll just go ahead and write pip install pandas.

203
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,330
So once I execute this, don't worry about this red mark.

204
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:17,670
Uh, because, uh, this will probably, uh, just as, uh, it is showing as a syntax error, but it

205
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,330
is not.

206
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,950
But if I just go ahead and write this, you will be able to see that the installation will take place,

207
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,140
uh, by using this Jupyter notebook.

208
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,750
But again, I would suggest this is not a very good way.

209
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,060
It is always better that you go ahead and update and requirement dot txt and go ahead and and pip install

210
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,350
minus our requirement dot txt.

211
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,660
Now you can see all the requirement dot txt has got.

212
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,790
Uh sorry this pandas has got installed.

213
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,020
So this is another way.

214
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,460
Again not a good way.

215
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,030
Uh, but if you are comfortable with this you can also go ahead with this.

216
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,690
Now this entire code you can go ahead and practice it.

217
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,890
So now you can see in in in if I probably go and open my VS code over here with all my code files,

218
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,450
it is in folder wise, right.

219
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,580
So you keep this as a reference and uh, you open another VS code over here.

220
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,180
Make sure that you also create folder by folder and start executing it.

221
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:06,660
Okay.

222
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,290
So I hope uh, you are able to understand about VS code.

223
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
I showed you how to create an environment.

224
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,630
I showed you how you can enable the Jupyter notebook and many more things.

225
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,190
So yes, this was it from my side.

226
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,620
Um, as we go ahead, see, guys, this entire course has probably taken me around six months to record.

227
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,880
So any new updates that will probably be coming up and which will be required?

228
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,640
I will make sure that I'll update in the further videos.

229
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:37,560
But one thing is that, uh, most of my solutions, uh, most of my course, uh, lectures is basically

230
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,700
taken in Jupyter notebook.

231
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,600
And later we moved into VS code, where we have developed end to end solutions.

232
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:47,700
Uh, so it is always good that, uh, you know, both the techniques and in industries, you'll definitely

233
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,660
be knowing both of them.

234
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,140
Okay.

235
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,850
So, uh, yes, this was it.

236
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,410
I will see you all in the next video.

237
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:52,830
Thank you.

238
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,100
Take care.
