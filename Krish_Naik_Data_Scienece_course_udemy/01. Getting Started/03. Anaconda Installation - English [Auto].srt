00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,040
Hello guys.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,770
So in this video we are going to go ahead with the installation of Anaconda and VS code which will be

3
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,270
our IDE, right.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,320
If you see just an example of VS code, this is how my VS code looks like.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:18,530
You know, a good, amazing, uh, complete IDE to probably execute your code.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,470
You can execute your code both in ipynb format.

7
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,200
You can execute your code in.py format and all.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,170
So this is entirely my VS code IDE, right?

9
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,660
So first of all, before we go ahead and install about VS code, first of all we need to go ahead and

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,160
install about Anaconda.

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,450
Anaconda is one amazing open source tool.

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,980
You know, it provides a complete open source ecosystem for sourcing, building and deploying data science

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,120
and AI initiative.

14
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:50,150
Okay, so, uh, if you really want to work with multiple environments, multiple packages.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:55,700
So this will be the best thing that you will probably have in order to get started with Python programming

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,120
language.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,630
Right.

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:02,060
And it is necessary that everybody uses this, you know because here the management of packages, the

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,890
management of environments will happen very much easily.

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:11,370
Now the importance of packages and management is very important because you may want to work with different

21
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,720
different versions of Python.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,330
So for that you really need to create a different environments.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,230
Okay, so let's get started and start with installation of Anaconda.

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,260
So first of all we will go ahead and click on Free download.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,290
So here you can see that once I click on free download I can uh if you go down okay.

26
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,110
So here you will be able to see what all things it basically supports.

27
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,560
Right now you can provide your email address.

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,770
Let's say I'm going to provide my email address over here Krishna zero six.

29
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,890
At the rate gmail.com I will click on submit okay.

30
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,560
Once I click on submit here, you will be able to see that I'm able to get the Download Now button over

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:46,980
here link.

32
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,520
Right.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,360
So I have windows, I have Mac, I have Linux okay.

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,000
Now based on your operating system it will automatically give whether you need to install 64 bit graphical

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,150
installer or whether you need to probably go ahead with Mac Linux.

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:00,330
Right?

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,800
Right now I am having windows, so I will just go ahead and click on this particular link.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,470
So once I click on this link here you can see that this entire link is basically getting downloaded.

39
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,530
Once it gets downloaded, we'll start the installation.

40
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,790
Okay, so I hope everybody remembers this specific step.

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,540
So first of all we need to go ahead and go to anaconda.com.

42
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,360
Click on free downloads, provide your email ID and just go ahead and go to this Download Now option.

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,830
And whichever is your operating system just go ahead and click on Download Now okay.

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,290
So once this is done, the next step that you can specifically do over here is that you can see that

45
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,720
my Anaconda exe file is ready.

46
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,440
I will double click on this and I will start my installation.

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,490
So here you can see I have already started my installation okay.

48
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,310
Setup will guide you through the installation of Anaconda three.

49
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,930
So and so version everything.

50
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,660
Then we will go ahead and click on next okay.

51
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,850
It will ask you for this license agreement.

52
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,340
So you just need to go ahead and click on I agree.

53
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:05,850
Now for if your system is basically used by multiple users, you can click on all users or you can just

54
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,080
click on just me right.

55
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:10,920
Since I'm using this particular workstation or laptop or anything.

56
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,340
I'll just click on just me so I will go ahead and click on next.

57
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,170
Now once I go ahead and click on next, it will ask me to select a destination folder.

58
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,530
Now by default, this destination folder is basically created in my C drive of Anaconda three, right?

59
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:29,310
If since Anaconda is already installed in my machine.

60
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,920
So here you are able to see this Anaconda three folder.

61
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,300
But let's say that you want to go ahead of the installation in some other folder by default.

62
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:38,280
Over here it will take the C drive, right.

63
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,320
If you want to go ahead with the other folder.

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,640
Also you can go ahead and select it.

65
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,630
Let's say that I want to probably go ahead with my desktop folder.

66
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,750
Here I will create my another folder.

67
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:54,240
Or let's say if I go to my E drive okay e drive here I have one Anaconda folder okay.

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:59,460
So please make sure that you write this Anaconda three because it needs to be matching with this right

69
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:04,020
in my C drive by default it is basically creating this Anaconda three folder okay.

70
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,660
But I want it to have it in E drive.

71
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,810
Let's say I'm just showing you multiple options You can also go ahead with C drive.

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,980
Also it is up to you.

73
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,120
So let's say I go ahead and select this.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,260
I will write okay.

75
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,990
And then I will go ahead and click on next.

76
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:22,090
So here you can see that it will give you multiple option create start menu shortcuts.

77
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,780
Add Anaconda three to my path environment variable not recommended.

78
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,180
Clear the package cache upon completion.

79
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,170
So what I will do.

80
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,330
I will also make sure that I will check this box.

81
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,230
Okay, it is saying not recommended, but I will tell you what is the importance of this.

82
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,220
Because once we go to our environment variable okay.

83
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,890
If I just go ahead and see my environment variable, one very important thing in this particular path,

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,130
right, is to have this anaconda path.

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,460
Right.

86
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:52,480
So this paths will be automatically added in the environment variable.

87
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,340
And because of this particular path you know, if it is added in the environment variable, it will

88
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,550
be very helpful when we execute any conda command.

89
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,150
Right.

90
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,270
With the help of conda command we will be creating a new environment.

91
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,500
We will be doing multiple things.

92
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,280
And all right.

93
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,930
So this will be very important.

94
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,410
Right.

95
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:15,460
And this path is only added when you specifically when you specifically just check this particular box.

96
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,620
That is, add Anaconda three to my path environment variable.

97
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,910
This is important.

98
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,280
Please do make sure that you check this okay.

99
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,580
And then what you can actually do you can click on install.

100
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,840
Once you click on install this is going to take some amount of time with respect to the installation.

101
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,720
Once the installation will happen, wherever you have selected the folder location right there, the

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,580
installation will happen automatically.

103
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:44,150
And also make sure that whenever you see your environment variable right, that environment variable

104
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,810
should have this path inserted over here.

105
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,320
Right?

106
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
So Anaconda three.

107
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,960
Anaconda three library this bin folder user bin folder library bin folder and scripts.

108
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,960
This for path needed to be added and it will get automatically added if you have done the checkbox.

109
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,440
Okay.

110
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,080
So this is very important because of without this, trust me your command is going to fail when you

111
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,340
write any conda command.

112
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:07,850
Okay.

113
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Like you want to do probably pip install.

114
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,220
You want to probably create an environment using conda that is not going to work.

115
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:13,760
Okay.

116
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,180
So once this installation is done I hope you will be able to do it.

117
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,690
Okay.

118
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,100
Just please go ahead and do it.

119
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,340
Once the installation is done, your anaconda will be ready.

120
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,450
Now, once you complete the installation, I will just go ahead and click on Anaconda.

121
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:26,810
Right.

122
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:31,640
So once I write Anaconda here you will be able to see that I'll be getting this Anaconda navigator.

123
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,370
So I will click on Anaconda Navigator over here.

124
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:39,620
Once I click on Anaconda Navigator here is what it will get displayed.

125
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,770
So this will be initializing and I will be able to see one.

126
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,730
Amazing.

127
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,800
Uh, you know, this entire Anaconda navigator will be opened as a window app.

128
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,370
Okay.

129
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:55,520
So this is going to just take some time because once you probably do the installation, you go ahead

130
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,480
and just open it.

131
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,990
So here you can see I have opened this.

132
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:00,260
Okay.

133
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,590
So this is my Anaconda navigator.

134
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,050
So in this Anaconda navigator you have Jupiter notebook.

135
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,370
You can directly click on launch.

136
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,000
Automatically.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,920
The Jupiter notebook will be opened.

138
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,350
You have other things like PyCharm.

139
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,640
You have data.

140
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,810
Uh datalore.

141
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,340
You have Watson Studio.

142
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,960
You have PyCharm professional.

143
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,760
All these are different different Ides.

144
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,420
Right.

145
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:24,260
And one of the main things is that I've already installed this anaconda.

146
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,120
You will be able to see that so many different different environments have created C, V and V, V and

147
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,370
V in different different folder location.

148
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,400
I will show you how to create an environment and all as we go ahead.

149
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:34,970
Okay.

150
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:41,060
Now after going ahead with this Anaconda navigator, the next thing that you need to install is your

151
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:41,960
VS code.

152
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:46,370
So in order to install the VS code I will click on VS code download.

153
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,060
Okay.

154
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:50,780
Then here my VS code link will be over here.

155
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:56,000
Just click on VS code download and this VS code is also available for everyone.

156
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,890
It is a complete open source.

157
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,190
So based on your operating system, whether it is windows OS or Mac, you just go ahead and install

158
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,610
this.

159
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:09,170
So I'll click this and the installation and the downloading will basically start.

160
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,090
Once the downloading is started just double click this do next next next and all the installation will

161
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,660
be done.

162
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,290
Okay.

163
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,850
Now how to start a VS code after the installation is done okay.

164
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,590
So right now I have the exe file.

165
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,330
I have already done the installation.

166
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,290
I will go to my folder.

167
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,460
Let's say that I want to start my Python programming language from this particular folder.

168
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,560
So I've created a Data Analyst Boot Camp folder.

169
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,840
Inside that I've created a Python folder.

170
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,440
Okay.

171
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,840
So from this particular folder what I will do I will go ahead and write my command prompt okay.

172
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,290
So I will open my command prompt inside this command prompt.

173
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:47,040
And remember you have to start this process after you install this.

174
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,960
But still this is getting downloaded.

175
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,420
Once it gets downloaded, just double click this.

176
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,440
Click on next, next next and on the installation will basically happen.

177
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,920
Okay, now I will go ahead and open my command prompt.

178
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,530
I will go to this specific folder location.

179
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:02,190
Right.

180
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,910
So I will say CD e this particular drive right.

181
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,140
So what did I do over here?

182
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:13,020
I wrote CD and this path that I have actually taken, I have just pasted it over here.

183
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,740
Okay.

184
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,750
Like this I'm pasting it over here.

185
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,100
So here it is.

186
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,810
And I will go to my e drive.

187
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,460
So here you can see once I go to my E drive automatically I'm going in that specific path.

188
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,230
Not only this, if you want to go ahead and start from here also you can go ahead and do it, you know.

189
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:30,690
So here if I do right click here.

190
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,180
You can see I'm getting open with code right.

191
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,990
If you are installing it for the first time, probably you may not get it right.

192
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,860
So here you can see my VS code is basically exe file is installed.

193
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:47,250
So if I double click this here you can see setup has detected that Visual Studio code is currently running.

194
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,610
Please close all the instances then click okay to continue.

195
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,380
So already my installation is done.

196
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,490
So I'm not going to do that.

197
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:56,160
But for you it will just keep on coming next next next.

198
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,900
And you can start now.

199
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,410
Once I go to my command prompt in this particular folder location.

200
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,830
Okay I will just go ahead and write code dot.

201
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,150
Once I write code dot, please make sure that you note this particular command.

202
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,690
Once I write code dot automatically my VS code will get opened in that specific folder location.

203
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,540
So here you can probably see Python right?

204
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:23,370
So once you have this particular Python you can go ahead and start your coding.

205
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:23,670
Right.

206
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,160
You can probably create a file let's say test dot ipynb file.

207
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,730
And you can start your coding.

208
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,300
Okay.

209
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,970
But this is more about coding.

210
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,410
We will see in the next video.

211
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,380
But I hope I've shown you how you can open the VS code, how you can do the installation of the VS code.

212
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:45,580
And all right, so two things I've actually focused on this particular video.

213
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,070
One was downloading your anaconda.

214
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,440
One was setting up your path environment.

215
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,720
Make sure to do that check box okay.

216
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,050
And the second thing that you really need to download is your VS code.

217
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,400
That is Visual Studio Code.

218
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,020
Double click it, install it.

219
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,880
Then in any folder location, let's say in this Python folder location, what I've done through my command

220
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,250
prompt, I've gone to this particular location and I've just written code space dot.

221
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,880
Once I write code space dot, my VS code will get opened.

222
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,110
So I hope you are able to understand this particular video in this entire course.

223
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:23,710
I'm going to use VS code as my ID, but if you still face any problem because of some or the other thing,

224
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,500
you can even start with Google Colab, right?

225
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,880
If you still face any kind of issues, please make sure that you write down in the discussion forum.

226
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,390
Right?

227
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,010
So yes, this was it from my side.

228
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,030
I will see you in the next video.

229
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,270
Thank you.
