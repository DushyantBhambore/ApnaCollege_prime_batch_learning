1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,810
So guys, we have seen different different data types again.

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,470
Hello guys.

3
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,200
So we are going to continue the discussion with respect to Python.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,960
Already in our previous video we have discussed about variables.

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,840
Now in this video we are going to discuss about data types.

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,140
Now here is the detailed video outline.

7
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,160
Uh, first of all we are going to understand the introduction to data types, uh importance of data

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,360
types in programming.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,220
Then we are going to explore some of the basic data types like integer floating point number strings

10
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,210
and booleans.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,950
And after that, uh, you know, after some number of videos we are going to see advanced data types,

12
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,770
uh, like list tuples, sets and dictionaries here.

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,410
There is a lot of operations that we really need to understand.

14
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,920
So I will be discussing about this topic further going ahead.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,690
And then you also have some examples with respect to type conversion and practical example.

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,620
Now first of all uh we need to understand the definition of data types.

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,330
What exactly data types are.

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,150
So here uh, data types are a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the

19
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,310
programmer intends to use the data.

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:58,790
Right?

21
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,890
They determine the type of operation that can be performed on the data, the values that the data can

22
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,740
take, and the amount of memory needed to store the data.

23
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:07,220
Right.

24
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,470
And as you all know, there are different different data types.

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:14,540
Uh, like, um, you know, if I probably say integer floating, they definitely require different amount

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,290
of memory, right?

27
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,730
Whenever they are storing some kind of, uh, information like you may have int eight bit, you may

28
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,650
have float 16 bits.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:21,920
Right.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,990
So different, different uh bits information will be there uh, for a specific data type.

31
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,710
Right now let's understand what are the importance of data type in programming.

32
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,120
So data types ensure that the data is stored in a very efficient way.

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,210
They help in performing correct operations on data.

34
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,630
And proper use of data types can prevent errors and bugs in the program.

35
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,140
And obviously memory management is also one of the very key term.

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,600
Okay, now let me just go ahead and show you with respect to the code, uh, and how we can basically

37
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,630
start with, okay, now the first, uh, example that we are going to go ahead, right, with respect

38
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,060
to the data types is nothing but integers.

39
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,790
So here I'm going to basically go ahead and write integers.

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,890
So this looks like a plain text.

41
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,460
Let me delete this because I don't want this I will go ahead and create.

42
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,430
So here um you will be able to see integers.

43
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,110
Example okay.

44
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,070
And uh first of all let me just go ahead and select the kernel okay.

45
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,450
So the kernel is over here.

46
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:21,080
Now let me go ahead and create a variable of an integer type.

47
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,660
Right now if I really want to create a variable I hope everybody is I have already told it.

48
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,640
Let's say age is equal to 35.

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,940
And if I go ahead and write type of age, this will specifically give me an integer value.

50
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:39,620
As I always said, whatever topics we are seeing again it will be getting repeated.

51
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,710
You know, we will just be seeing that how uh, more things we can actually learn about this right now.

52
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,870
See, I have already spoken about variables.

53
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,340
I have already spoken about integer.

54
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,690
But since we are learning now about data types here also, you'll be able to see that so many different

55
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,820
things are there right then.

56
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,710
Um, once I probably create an integer variable, you can also go ahead and create a floating point

57
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,010
number.

58
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:07,520
So let's say my floating point number uh over here floating point data type okay.

59
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,120
Floating point data type here I'm going to specifically use it.

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,260
And let's say over here I define like, uh, you know, um, sentiment or let's say I will, I will

61
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,180
probably define the width right, or width or height or anything.

62
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,920
So let's go ahead and define height.

63
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,470
So let's say that if I'm writing 5.11.

64
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,690
So this uh will be nothing.

65
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,210
But if I go ahead and print the height.

66
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:32,870
Right.

67
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,310
And if I go ahead and print the type of the height right.

68
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,450
So here you will be able to see that I will be able to get my floating point number right.

69
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,480
So here you can see I'm able to get 5.11.

70
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,100
And this is nothing but class float.

71
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,720
This class was nothing but INT I've already spoken about typecasting also.

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,080
Right.

73
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,090
So this is one of the other data type like floating data type uh floating data point example.

74
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,770
Um, and the next example that I can probably take is for string.

75
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,020
So string data type example okay I will be showing you more examples as we go ahead.

76
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,080
So let me say this is name is Krish okay.

77
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:17,000
And uh here you can probably see I'll go ahead and print the name and let me just go ahead and see print

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,940
type of name okay.

79
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:22,310
So here you can actually see that okay fine.

80
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,490
I'm able to see all these things I'm able to get this information and.

81
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:26,210
All right.

82
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,940
And similarly one more common data type that we will be specifically using is something called as boolean

83
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,450
data type.

84
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:32,990
Right.

85
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,460
And again guys I'm not showing you much operations because operations will be coming as we go ahead.

86
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,790
Right.

87
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,910
Uh, when will be learning about our next tutorial.

88
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,070
Right where we'll be learning about operators.

89
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,320
At that time, we'll be discussing more about operations, how we can use this and probably, uh, do

90
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,370
different types of operation.

91
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:49,520
And.

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,030
All right.

93
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:54,770
So for Boolean, uh, what you can do is that, uh, I can directly define true or false.

94
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,360
So if I probably use true right.

95
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,100
So this is basically a boolean value.

96
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,490
Right.

97
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,870
If I go ahead and see the type.

98
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,700
Right stripe.

99
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,680
So here you can see it is a bool value right.

100
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,510
So this is one way how you can define it.

101
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,140
Let's say I define saying that is true right.

102
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,660
And I may assign it to true right.

103
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:18,950
And if I go ahead and see the type of is true type off is underscore true, you'll be able to see,

104
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,160
hey fine, I'm actually able to get the boolean value right.

105
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,270
This is one way.

106
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,940
The other way is that I may go ahead and directly assign a bool variable.

107
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,540
Right.

108
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,750
And let me just go ahead and execute this okay.

109
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,010
So here you can see uh when we use a boolean variable right.

110
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,480
Or let me do like this.

111
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,290
Right.

112
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,190
So let's say uh I want to go ahead and define a boolean variable.

113
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,010
So I will go ahead and write bool okay.

114
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,810
And if I go ahead and execute it right.

115
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,530
By default it is probably coming as false right now.

116
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:56,150
Uh, I can also give some other conditions like let's say uh, I have two variables.

117
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,690
Right.

118
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,300
Uh, let's say I have two variables.

119
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,710
Let me define it out.

120
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,560
A is equal to ten okay.

121
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,360
And B is equal to ten okay.

122
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,430
Now if I sorry this is getting added I don't know why.

123
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,020
So B is equal to ten okay.

124
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,670
So there is some built in functions and all.

125
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:15,320
I think that is why it is getting applied.

126
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,380
If I write a double equal to B right.

127
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,240
So over here I'm able to get true.

128
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,690
Right.

129
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,670
And even though I see when I'm doing this specific operation, if I go and see the type it is again

130
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,150
Boolean.

131
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,540
Right.

132
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,990
So Boolean is another one data type which we can specifically use.

133
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,120
And this is just for true and false right.

134
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:34,460
Uh that is why Boolean is specifically used.

135
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,700
Right.

136
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,880
So we will be seeing more of this kind of examples as we go ahead.

137
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,660
Right.

138
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,930
And I know you are excited to see a lot of operations, but let's go from basics and then we will try

139
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,610
to build up more and more concepts.

140
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,090
Right at the end of the day, you really need to try and work hard, right?

141
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,650
And the more you work hard, uh, it is more like you'll become more perfect in it, right?

142
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,940
So let's see some of the common errors that we may probably face.

143
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,220
You know, some of the common errors that we may get, uh, whenever we are working with, uh, different,

144
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,820
different data types, let's say, uh, my result is something called as hello right now for this particular

145
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,240
result.

146
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,630
Right.

147
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:18,070
And uh, let's say I want to go ahead and add five.

148
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,340
Okay.

149
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,210
Now what will happen.

150
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,500
Let's check okay.

151
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:27,100
And if I go ahead and execute this here you'll be able to see that I am getting an error right.

152
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,690
It is saying can only concatenate string right not integer.

153
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,710
And here you can see on the left hand side it is basically a string.

154
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:40,510
And on the right hand side when I'm performing this specific operation, I'm actually giving an integer.

155
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,450
So if I really need to fix this error, all I have to do is that go ahead and write this okay.

156
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,620
And over here I need to do the typecasting right.

157
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:56,440
So let's say if I go ahead and write str of five then this issue will definitely get fixed.

158
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:56,890
Right.

159
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,030
And if I go ahead and print it print the result okay.

160
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,730
So here you'll be able to see I'm able to get hello five.

161
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,040
Now that is the power of typecasting.

162
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,810
See in this particular case when I was trying to concatenate or add five over here.

163
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:11,050
Right.

164
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,500
And obviously it is not possible because this is a string and this is a numerical value.

165
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,540
We cannot perform any mathematical operation.

166
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:16,960
Right.

167
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,050
And uh, here you can actually see that I'm able to get this.

168
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,450
So these are some of the common errors like minimal common errors that you may be facing.

169
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,440
Uh, but we will deep dive more into different, different operations.

170
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,840
And one more thing that I really want to talk about.

171
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,340
Uh, let's say if I want to define a string, right, let's say like, hello.

172
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:39,100
Okay, now you'll be able to see string dot.

173
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,260
There are so many different, different methods.

174
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:41,830
Right.

175
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,250
If I probably go ahead and see there are so many different, different methods.

176
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:51,340
If I go ahead and see over here, see so many different, different methods like is this it is uh,

177
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:58,450
is alphanumeric, is uh, you know, case fold center clear copy count difference difference update.

178
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:04,000
So we will also be seeing this kind of operations once we go ahead towards the advanced data type.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,230
Because see we need to understand all these methods because all these methods once you understand you

180
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,400
will be able to understand it how you will be using in different different operations.

181
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,630
But right now, since we are just discussing with the basics and we are just in the fourth tutorial,

182
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:22,900
uh, I want to go a little bit slowly, uh, with definition, with examples show you multiple things

183
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:28,120
and uh, make sure that you learn things in a way that it it matters a lot to you.

184
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,600
Right.

185
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,340
And uh, again, uh, as I said, uh, uh, be patience with respect to this.

186
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,620
I know many people will be excited saying that.

187
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,420
Hey, Krish, quickly complete fast.

188
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:37,870
Right.

189
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,130
But let me go a little bit slowly so that you will be able to understand things.

190
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,610
Okay.

191
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,760
So, uh, yes, uh, this was it from my side.

192
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,400
I hope you like this particular video.

193
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,750
Um, yes.

194
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,820
I will see you all in the next video.

195
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,510
Thank you.
