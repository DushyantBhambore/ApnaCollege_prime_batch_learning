1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:01,090
Hello guys.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,980
So welcome to the Python series.

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:08,020
Uh, now we are going to start our first session with respect to Python.

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,390
Now, what we are going to do in this video is that, uh, uh, and the entire code that I'm actually

5
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:17,920
going to specifically write, I'm going to use the VS code IDE, uh, vs code IDE.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:24,280
I find it really amazing because here you will be able to execute your Jupyter notebook files, your.py

7
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:24,670
files.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,900
Along with that, you'll also be able to create all the environments very much easily.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,680
Uh, so it is feasible that I specifically use VS code.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,960
Along with that, you have lot of features like extensions, code assistance, and many more things.

11
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,510
So the first step, uh, as we have seen starting, you know, uh, what I'm actually going to do is

12
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:50,110
that over here, we are going to create our new environment, as I said, um, in this Python series,

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,950
I'm going to use the newest Python version that is Python 3.12.

14
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:59,590
And, uh, I am going to teach in such a way that we all, we see all the new features that have actually

15
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,220
come from 3.10 to 3.12.

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,170
So all the new features that are specifically there, uh, we will be also discussing about them in

17
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,340
this Python series.

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,350
Uh, the first step, as you know, that, uh, I'm going to create an environment and again, why you

19
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,360
specifically require an environment because, uh, an environment is, uh, necessary whenever you start

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,410
a new project.

21
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:26,110
Because in our Python project or in our data science project, we make sure that we use multiple packages,

22
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,430
multiple libraries and.

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:27,760
All right.

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,310
And, uh, every couple of months this packages or this libraries have new features and most of them

25
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,900
are open source packages or libraries.

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,080
Right.

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,880
So they definitely have a lot of features that gets included every couple of months.

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,610
So it is always necessary that you always maintain, uh, or try to create your entire projects in a

29
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,980
separate, uh, with a separate environment so that there should be not any conflict, as you probably

30
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:55,720
go ahead, uh, whenever a new feature is probably coming up, you know, with respect to the packages,

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,500
uh, you can actually create a new project and create a new environment out there.

32
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,940
But here, uh, the first step, what I'm actually going to do is that let's go ahead and create our

33
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,390
environment.

34
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,570
And for this also I will be using Conda command.

35
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,180
So first of all I'll not go ahead and write in PowerShell.

36
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,030
Instead I'll go and click on uh Command prompt.

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,550
So quickly let's go ahead and write it down.

38
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,880
So here I'm going to write conda create minus p v and v python uh double equal to.

39
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,030
Let's say I want to go ahead with Python 3.12 okay.

40
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,960
And uh understand one thing is that, uh over here we are using this conda create command v and v is

41
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:37,150
specifically your environment name and which Python version we are specifically using.

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,110
It is 3.12.

43
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,510
Again based on different different projects.

44
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,420
It is not necessary that you always need to use 3.12.

45
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:48,040
It depends on the kind of packages that are available, let's say open source packages.

46
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,850
When we are creating deep learning projects or any machine learning projects as such.

47
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,060
Right.

48
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,680
So but here, uh, since we are learning this Python series completely from basics, I'm going to go

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,120
ahead and use this environment.

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,740
So once I probably click this.

51
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,340
So here you'll be able to see the installation will start taking place.

52
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,040
And when we are creating a virtual environment, some basic libraries or packages will be automatically

53
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,780
downloaded by this conda command.

54
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:17,050
So now here uh you can see over here what are the basic commands, uh, basic new packages that are

55
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,280
basically getting installed.

56
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,110
So here are all the packages.

57
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:23,320
So I'm just going to go ahead and click on uh press Y.

58
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,940
And once I probably do this all the installation of the libraries will happen.

59
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,360
Right.

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,790
So uh, it is going to take some amount of time.

61
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,650
Again, it depends on your internet speed.

62
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,360
But let me just go ahead and show you.

63
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,660
So here you can see a V and V environment is basically created.

64
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,990
And these are all the default packages that you will be able to find out.

65
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,690
Inside this right there will be a DLL folder.

66
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,520
There will be an include folder.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:45,820
Right.

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,890
So uh what is the basic environment that is required for any Python project.

69
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,010
Uh, so that will be covered up inside this particular folder.

70
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,520
Okay.

71
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,520
Now once you go ahead and click this uh, now the next thing is that let's say um, you want to activate

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,600
this environment, right?

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,410
So in order to activate this environment I will go ahead and write conda activate.

74
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,370
And we go ahead and use this v and v folder itself.

75
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:09,610
Right.

76
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,020
The same v and v folder.

77
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,960
And here we are just going to give the location of this right.

78
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,570
So once we press this you'll be able to see that I have activated the V and V environment okay.

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:27,010
And now you can probably run any kind of.py files directly from here by using Python specifically.

80
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:31,180
Let's say I probably go ahead and create my app.py.

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:35,950
And let's say that I am just going to write over here print one plus one.

82
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,490
Right.

83
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:41,350
So this is the basic command uh, and I'm printing this particular numerical operation one plus one.

84
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,110
Now if I really want to run this app.py, I have to make sure that I'm in the same folder location.

85
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,090
I have activated my v env environment.

86
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,740
And now within this particular environment, we will go ahead and just execute this file.

87
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,010
In order to execute it you just need to write python app.py.

88
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,560
So once you do this here you'll be able to see that I'm.

89
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Able to get the response.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,480
Okay.

91
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,180
Now, uh, let me show you one more thing, because, see, uh, as we go ahead with more lectures.

92
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,480
Right.

93
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,400
I'm actually going to create a folder.

94
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,360
Let's say this is first folder is Python basics okay.

95
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,680
Python basics.

96
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,530
So inside this folder itself I will go ahead and create my Jupyter notebook file or.py file.

97
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,640
Anything that I require.

98
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,270
Let's say I go ahead and create my Jupyter notebook file by default.

99
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,150
Uh, let's say this is my test dot ipynb.

100
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:34,120
Okay, now this Jupyter notebook file, uh, will be the similar Jupyter notebook file that we actually

101
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,890
use in, uh, Anaconda.

102
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,220
Right.

103
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,350
Uh, the Jupyter notebook, but in Python also, uh, sorry, in VS code, you will be able to see that.

104
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:46,150
Yes, internally you will be able to execute this text, uh, this uh, Jupyter notebook file also.

105
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:51,760
Now initially if I go ahead and uh, let's say over here, an option is probably coming up saying that,

106
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,320
hey, detecting kernels.

107
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,620
So if I want to say select the same environment, right V and V I can go ahead and click on Detect kernels.

108
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:03,070
So here you'll get an option of selecting the Python environment.

109
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,560
Let's say this is the environment that I have created right.

110
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,890
Uh v and v Python 3.12.0.

111
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,210
And these are all the other environments that I've actually created in my, uh, local system.

112
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:13,510
Right.

113
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,420
So I'm just going to go ahead and select uh, 3.12.

114
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,350
Oh okay.

115
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,510
Now let's go ahead and execute any code.

116
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:19,720
Right.

117
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,370
So this is my code cell okay.

118
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,480
I can create any number of code cell that I really want right now.

119
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,290
Code cell is nothing.

120
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,070
But here I will be writing all my Python code in order to execute it.

121
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,380
Along with that you also have something like markdown.

122
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,310
So let's say that I, uh I have this markdown cell.

123
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,740
I can basically write comments saying like this.

124
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:38,980
Right.

125
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,600
Let's say Python example.

126
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:46,840
And if I execute it, in order to execute this cell I have to press shift enter.

127
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,260
Okay.

128
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,740
So if I probably press shift enter automatically this will get executed.

129
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,180
Now the the reason we have used some markdown because I needed to write some information over here.

130
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,440
So like title and all.

131
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,700
So I'm writing it over here.

132
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,240
Right.

133
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,200
So if you press shift enter then automatically this cell will get executed.

134
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,750
Uh along with this you also have an option of run all you know, if you want to run all the cells over

135
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:13,240
here, if you go ahead and, uh, see if you just go, go ahead and press right click, you'll be having

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,590
so many different, different options.

137
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,040
Okay.

138
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,140
But we are just going to use shift run uh shift enter so that we'll be able to execute it okay.

139
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,310
Now this is fine.

140
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,190
Let's run our first code in Jupyter Notebook.

141
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,810
So if I am going to write one plus one.

142
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,950
So here you can see I'm getting an error running cell with v and v.

143
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,720
Python 3.0120 requires the ipykernel package.

144
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,110
Okay.

145
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,570
So this is one of the requirement that we really need to do, uh, we need to install Ipykernel.

146
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:40,990
Okay.

147
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:44,320
So here I'm what I'm going to write is that pip install.

148
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:49,210
If I want to install any packages I have to just go ahead and write pip install Ipykernel.

149
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:49,630
Okay.

150
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,420
So once I probably do this you'll be able to see that if I press enter you'll be seeing that hey, my

151
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,340
Ipykernel is basically getting installed now.

152
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,140
What is this Ipykernel package?

153
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,940
Ipykernel package is nothing but it provides a kernel to this specific Jupyter notebook, which will

154
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,570
be responsible in executing the Python code, right?

155
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,840
It is pretty much necessary and compulsory in Anaconda.

156
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,920
The default Jupyter notebook has Ipykernel already integrated to it.

157
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,560
Okay, so this is the first thing that you really need to do.

158
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,870
Whenever you want to run the Jupyter notebook, you just go ahead and write pip install Ipykernel.

159
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,160
One more thing that you can actually do is that here what I will do, I will go ahead and create one

160
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,950
requirement dot txt because this requirement dot txt you know later on whatever packages I want.

161
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,380
Let's say the first package I want is Ipykernel.

162
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,630
I'll keep a note of this over here and any number of packages I will be requiring let's say in the future

163
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,230
classes you'll be seeing pandas numpy different different packages.

164
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,570
So we will try to install it from here itself.

165
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,920
We'll write over here and we'll run this requirement dot txt which will be responsible in installing

166
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,790
all the packages.

167
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,480
Now you can see that uh, the Ipykernel has got successfully executed.

168
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,940
Now let me just go ahead and run this same code.

169
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,310
So here you'll be able to see if I run this same code.

170
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,960
Now it is just going to execute.

171
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,640
It is saying that connecting to kernel.

172
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,830
And here I am having my output.

173
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,280
Right.

174
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,670
So now I can probably go ahead and write any type of code that I want.

175
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,620
Let's say I want to go ahead and write print.

176
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:14,320
Hello hello world.

177
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,680
Okay.

178
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,610
Something like this.

179
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,600
So here we'll be able to see that it is executing right for.py file.

180
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,540
I don't want any type of kernel because in the terminal in the terminal automatically that particular

181
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,270
terminal uh has this environment setup.

182
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:28,600
Right.

183
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,400
So in order to execute it I have to go ahead and write python app.py right.

184
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,960
Or whatever is the file name.

185
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:40,840
In this case, if I want to execute any cell, I have to just press that particular cell and press shift

186
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,440
enter.

187
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,950
Okay.

188
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,960
So in this video we have discussed about how you can go ahead and create your environment.

189
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,850
Because going forward, any session that is probably going to come up in this course, I'm going to

190
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,010
probably create a folder wise like this.

191
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,530
For first class I will probably create Python basics, create my Jupyter notebook file or.py file.

192
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,150
Execute all the code in front of you.

193
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,490
Write all the code in front of you and continue.

194
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:03,880
Right.

195
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,770
So for right now, I will just go ahead and delete this folder because I don't require it, because

196
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,200
at the end of the day, I will do one thing.

197
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,220
Okay, just a second.

198
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,750
I will just close this okay.

199
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,770
Yeah.

200
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,660
Now let me just go ahead and delete it.

201
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,120
Because in the next session I will go ahead and create everything from scratch requirement dot txt I

202
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,850
will keep it so that I keep on updating my packages.

203
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,430
So yes, this was it for my side.

204
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,650
I hope uh you like this video.

205
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:33,310
And in the next video we will start our Python basics.

206
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,930
So yes, this was it.

207
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:35,440
Thank you.

208
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:35,950
Take care.

209
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,520
Bye bye.
