00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,830
Hello guys.

2
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,430
So we are going to continue the discussion with respect to Python programming language.

3
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,340
Now in this first video we are going to probably discuss about syntax and semantics in Python.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,850
So I have given the video outline what all things we are going to cover over here.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,780
So first of all we are going to understand about single line comments and multi line comments.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,520
Uh, along with this we are going to understand what is the definition of syntax and semantics.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,610
And then uh we'll see basic syntax rules in Python.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,550
Then we'll also be understanding about semantics in Python.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,660
And what are the common syntax errors and how to avoid them.

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:36,680
And uh, we'll also be seeing a lot of practical code examples okay.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,500
Now first of all let's go ahead with the definition over here.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,100
So here you can clearly see that syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combination of symbols

13
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:50,210
that are considered to be correctly structured program in a language.

14
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,800
In a simpler terms, syntax is about the correct arrangement of words and symbol in a code.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,970
Now understand when we are doing coding right, uh, we usually face some kind of syntax error.

16
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,040
Why it usually happens.

17
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,960
It may be because let's say I've not assigned a variable and I've directly used it, you know, so I

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,130
may get a syntax error.

19
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,360
So that is the reason it is written over here that it is a correct arrangement of words and symbols

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,670
in a code right now.

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:20,150
Uh, this is a basic definition of syntax.

22
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:25,040
I would also like to give you some more definition for semantics okay.

23
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
So let's go ahead and write it over here.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,720
So here you can see semantics refers to the meaning or interpretation of the symbol character and commands

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,470
in a language.

26
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,350
It is about what the code is supposed to do and it runs.

27
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:44,090
Syntax is how we are able to arrange the words so that we write a code, and semantics refers to the

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:44,990
interpretation.

29
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:50,030
So whatever code, we are specifically writing what it is supposed to do, right?

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,600
When it runs, like when we are trying to run it, what it is supposed to do, it is more about the

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,520
task that we are trying to do, right?

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,830
And that is what semantics basically refer to.

33
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,260
Now this is some kind of basic definition.

34
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,990
I know you usually don't go through this, but, uh, I really wanted to explain you in a way that a

35
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,720
basic anyone can actually be able to understand this who is also starting Python programming language.

36
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,230
Okay.

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:26,010
Now let's go ahead and see some of the basic syntax in Basic syntax rules in Python okay.

38
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,420
Now first first and the foremost important thing is about case sensitivity okay.

39
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,610
So I'm going to write a comment over here.

40
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,110
Case sensitivity.

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,110
Now before I go ahead you will be able to see that whenever I use double hash in a code.

42
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,970
Uh, see whenever we create a coding cell.

43
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,510
Right.

44
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,400
And if I want to write some kind of comments, a single line comment, I can basically use this double

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,820
hash.

46
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,040
So this double hash basically means that whenever I want to use a single line comment, I can just use

47
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,970
this, and I can write any kind of comments that I want, like I have written over here.

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,050
Let's say that in this code cell I'm going to discuss about basic syntax rules in Python.

49
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,360
So I have just written double hash over here.

50
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,780
Okay.

51
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:11,400
Let's say uh and there is also an option to use multi line comments okay.

52
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,870
Now multi line comments.

53
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,510
Let's say that I've created one test.py file over here.

54
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,040
Now for multi line comment let's say I'll write this is a multi line comment or sorry this double hash

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,390
is a single line comment.

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,590
And in case of multi line comment I have to use triple quotes right.

57
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,600
Something like this triple quotes.

58
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,200
So I will say welcome to the right to the Python course.

59
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,330
So that basically means I'm using 2 to 3 lines.

60
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,650
And I'm writing this particular lines.

61
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:40,830
Right.

62
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm I'm, I'm giving some kind of comments over here.

63
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,170
Now whenever I have comments which, which expands to multiple lines, I can definitely use this triple

64
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:49,680
quotes.

65
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,750
So these are the two ways of writing comments in Python programming language.

66
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,170
Okay.

67
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:02,400
The reason, uh, why I have used this test dot p y and uh, c again in Python you can actually use

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,870
I p y n b file, which is the Jupyter notebook file or.py file, which is a Python file.

69
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,310
Now uh, this triple quotes usually does not work in Jupyter notebook.

70
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,650
It only works in test.py file.

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,160
Right?

72
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,220
Other than that, single line comments definitely work for both Jupyter notebook and the py file, basically

73
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,030
the python file.

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:26,280
So I hope you got an idea of understanding about single line comments and multi line comments.

75
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,880
Now let's go ahead and see some of the basic syntax in Python.

76
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,890
So first point that I really want to talk about is case sensitivity.

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,600
And to give you a good comment over here Python is.

78
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,290
Case sensitive.

79
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,890
So guys now let me go ahead and define a variable.

80
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:50,200
Let's say this is a variable.

81
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,060
Um and what exactly is a variable.

82
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,260
Again I will give a definition.

83
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,940
But let's consider that a variable is something that stores some information okay.

84
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,860
Let's say in this particular variable I define my name that is Krish okay.

85
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,940
And let's say I again define a variable which capital n and I write the same variable name that is name.

86
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,180
And here let's say that I am just going to use another name.

87
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,290
Let's say Nick.

88
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,770
Okay.

89
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:24,610
Now one thing that you really need to know if I print this particular name and if I print the next name

90
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:30,340
right over here, both this name are different variables, right?

91
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,720
It is not the same variable, even though even though the variable meaning is same.

92
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:34,990
Right.

93
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,650
Name name.

94
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,190
Right.

95
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,750
But I've told over here that Python is case sensitive, right?

96
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:45,610
That basically means both this variable are different identifiers.

97
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,120
Okay.

98
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,670
So if I am going to execute this here you can see the first name is displaying Krish and the second

99
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,840
name is displaying Nick.

100
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,560
Right.

101
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,390
So that is the reason we say that hey Python is case sensitive right.

102
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,890
Both this variable.

103
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,400
Right.

104
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,610
If we are writing we always need to make sure that, uh, you know, let's say that, uh, I have defined

105
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,430
this name over here and again, I've defined name, uh, unless and until both this, both this variable

106
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,560
are having that case sensitive things.

107
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:14,890
Right.

108
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:20,080
That basically means if I, even though I'm writing with the small, uh, uh, small n later letter

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,250
over here, then I will be considering both this variable as same.

110
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,890
Otherwise this will be treated as a different identifier.

111
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,130
Right.

112
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,830
So this is one of the very much important information.

113
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,900
Now coming to the second thing right.

114
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,620
Second point let's talk about something called as indentation.

115
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,330
Right now.

116
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,250
What exactly is indentation okay.

117
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,640
And this is also very much important to understand.

118
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,110
I'll just write a comment over here.

119
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,190
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code.

120
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,140
Consistent use of space commonly for spaces or a tab is required.

121
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,020
Okay, now what exactly is indentation?

122
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,560
Okay.

123
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,290
And uh, if you really want to have a definition for indentation okay.

124
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,650
Uh, so we can also define indentation over here.

125
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,680
So let me just go ahead and give you some kind of definition okay.

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,360
I will be using a markdown cell.

127
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,120
And let me just go ahead and write over here right.

128
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,780
And let's go through this particular indentation definition.

129
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,470
So let me just go ahead and execute.

130
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,610
Indentation in Python is used to define the structure and hierarchy of the code.

131
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,970
Unlike many other programming languages that uses braces to delimit block of codes, right.

132
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,750
Python uses indentation to determine the grouping of statement.

133
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:40,870
Okay, now indentation is something that is very much necessary whenever you are writing some clauses.

134
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,050
Let's say if block or for loop or something else.

135
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:44,560
Right.

136
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,730
So let's say I'll give you an example over here, I will I will define a variable.

137
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,680
Let's say age is equal to 32.

138
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:53,200
And let me just go ahead and write one if condition.

139
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,530
Don't worry if you don't know about if condition how do we write it?

140
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:57,880
What is the syntax and all?

141
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:04,300
I will, uh, explain this as we go ahead, but I just want to give you an idea about indentation.

142
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:08,590
So let's say if I write if age is equal to greater than 30.

143
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,040
Now when I write, if age is greater than 30.

144
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,460
And if I just use this colon now see what will happen if I press enter.

145
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,550
It is going to start inside this particular block.

146
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:21,370
And automatically it did not start from here.

147
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,260
Instead it started from here.

148
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:23,830
Right?

149
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,140
So it is what it is basically doing.

150
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,540
It is using indentation, right?

151
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,930
It is using consistent use of space commonly four or tab.

152
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,500
Right.

153
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,920
And here it is for a block of statement right.

154
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,820
Block of code.

155
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,330
Right.

156
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:44,050
So here if I'm going to write let's say that I'm going to print 30 over here I'm just going to print

157
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:44,530
age.

158
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:50,530
Right now what is basically happening over here I've just used this uh, if block.

159
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,190
Right.

160
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:56,710
And because of indentation, we know that this code is only going to get executed when this is true.

161
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,460
Okay.

162
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:03,640
If I go ahead outside and if I print it print age, that basically means this is not inside the if clause,

163
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,210
right?

164
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,290
Usually in other programming languages we usually write this kind of braces.

165
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:08,560
Right?

166
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,570
We we try to define this kind of braces.

167
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:14,350
If you know other programming languages like C plus plus or C sharp.

168
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:14,830
Right.

169
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:20,320
But in Python, instead of using this braces automatically it will be aligned with indentation.

170
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,320
Now let me just go ahead and execute it this time.

171
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,270
Two times is basically getting displayed 32.

172
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,520
So one is this and the other one is over here.

173
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,890
Understand this age is basically getting displayed but this is outside the if block okay.

174
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:39,730
So this is giving you an idea about indentation okay I've already explained you about comments, but

175
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,560
let me just go ahead and write about single.

176
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,700
So first single comment.

177
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,710
Let's say this is a single line comment.

178
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,980
I'll go ahead and write single line comment.

179
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,650
Let's say that I'm going to print Hello World.

180
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,970
Okay.

181
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:59,600
Now if I go ahead and execute this, you can see only Hello World is getting displayed.

182
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,260
This this comment section is not getting printed right.

183
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,970
Again, why do we write comments?

184
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,500
Let's say that I want to define a function.

185
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,960
I want to give some information about this particular function.

186
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,840
I can write all those info in this comment section okay.

187
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,720
Now uh, this is important okay.

188
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,800
Now let me just go ahead and talk more about different, different syntaxes.

189
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,070
One more syntax is something called as line continuation.

190
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,580
So here I'm going to basically write line continuation.

191
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:29,300
Now what exactly is line continuation okay.

192
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,980
Let's say I am going to create a variable total okay.

193
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:42,410
And I'm doing some mathematical operation like one plus two plus three plus four plus five plus six

194
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,550
plus seven.

195
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,250
Let's say this line is becoming bigger and bigger, right?

196
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,860
So this line is really becoming bigger and bigger.

197
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,420
Let's say I want to go to the next line.

198
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,670
So what I can actually do let's say I will write plus and now I will use a black slash.

199
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:59,690
Now if I use a backslash if I press enter then what is going to happen.

200
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,180
It is just going to continue in the new line okay.

201
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,650
So here I will just use this and then let me go ahead and press backslash.

202
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:11,090
And let's say I go ahead and add more elements like four plus five plus six.

203
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:17,450
Now if I go ahead and print total you'll be able to see this will also do all the operation.

204
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:30,170
So if I do the calculation 1318, 22, 25, 27, 28, 28 and uh 28 plus six, 34, 39, 43 right.

205
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,940
And I'm able to get the answer.

206
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:41,810
So you can use right, in case of uh, basically line continuation, you can basically use a backslash.

207
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,500
Right.

208
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,800
And you can continue the statement to the next line.

209
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,220
Okay.

210
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,810
So this is very much important.

211
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,760
Again one of the most amazing feature.

212
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,300
And again let me just show you one more thing.

213
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,090
Uh, one more amazing thing with respect to syntax and semantics.

214
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:01,340
Uh, that is nothing but multiple statements on a single line.

215
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,360
On a single line.

216
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,800
Now what does this basically mean?

217
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,170
Let's say I want to assign one value.

218
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,400
Let's say x is equal to five.

219
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,740
I have defined I want to define another variable.

220
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,210
Let's say y is equal to ten.

221
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:16,930
Again uh, if I want to define another variable I'll use a colon.

222
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,630
And I'll go ahead and write x is equal to x plus y.

223
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,360
Now what is basically happening in a single line of uh in a single line I've used multiple statement

224
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,720
I've assigned x is equal to five, y is equal to ten, Z is equal to x plus y.

225
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,140
Now if I go ahead and print z you see I will be able to get the answer.

226
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,870
See ten plus five is equal to nothing but 15 right.

227
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,930
So guys now you here you can see that this kind of operation can also be performed right now let's uh,

228
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,900
go ahead and understand semantics okay.

229
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,510
And here also I'm going to put some points.

230
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,120
So understanding semantics in Python.

231
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:54,700
Okay.

232
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,350
Now the first thing uh that we are going to understand is about variable assignment.

233
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:03,910
So what exactly is variable assignment.

234
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,770
Let's say that I define a variable like age is equal to 32 okay.

235
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:17,620
So here when we run this particular command right when we run this line of code, then in other programming

236
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,910
language you usually define the data type beforehand like int age float age.

237
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:27,100
But here in Python the kernel automatically understands during the runtime.

238
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,770
So here the kernel will understand that age is an integer, because here we are assigning some integer

239
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,220
value.

240
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,600
Similarly, let's say I go ahead and write name is equal to Chris.

241
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,770
So here you will be able to see that name will be a string right.

242
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,030
So name is a string.

243
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,610
So I will just go ahead and execute this.

244
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:51,280
If you want to understand whether I am probably how to probably check the type of this.

245
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,300
So I will go ahead and write type of age and let me just go ahead and execute it.

246
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,360
So here you'll be able to see that hey I'm getting an integer value.

247
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,690
So this basically indicates that age is an integer.

248
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:05,350
Then if I go ahead and execute type off name.

249
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:09,520
So here you'll be able to see that hey it is an STR type that is nothing but string type.

250
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,290
Now, uh, let me do one thing.

251
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:14,610
Okay.

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,450
Uh.

253
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,600
This the type that we have actually run, right?

254
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,960
It is also called as something called as type inferencing.

255
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:26,230
So here I'm going to basically write type inference.

256
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,170
Now Python infers the type of a variable at the runtime.

257
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,740
And this is basically allowing dynamic typing okay.

258
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,320
So what does it basically mean over here.

259
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,510
Is that uh okay I will just use this in the other code.

260
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,200
Let's see.

261
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,190
So if I go ahead and write over here I'll create a variable.

262
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,680
Variable is equal to ten okay.

263
00:14:50,980 --> 00:15:00,040
And let's say I go ahead and write print type of var right as sorry this will be variable okay.

264
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,500
Now what is basically going to happen over here.

265
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Once you probably execute this you are able to get an answer saying that hey it is of int type and the

266
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,000
class will be int okay.

267
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:17,860
But if I go ahead and use the same variable and assign some other name or some other value, let's say

268
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,340
Krish.

269
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:26,320
Now if I go ahead and print the type of variable now what I'm actually going to get right.

270
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,570
So here you'll be able to see that I will be able to get str for the same variable itself.

271
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,110
Right.

272
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:38,680
So here you'll be able to see that whenever we refer to the type of this specific variable, we will

273
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,700
be also able to see something very amazing as we keep on changing.

274
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,810
This particular variable will be also able to see the inferencing type right.

275
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,680
So basically when we are searching for type of this it is basically showing different different things.

276
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,690
So that basically means what during the runtime you can change the type of the variable with different

277
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,620
different values.

278
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,310
Okay.

279
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,560
Now uh this was one of the most amazing thing, uh, with respect to semantics.

280
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,100
Okay.

281
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:09,850
Uh, and uh, as, as, you know, something, uh, over here is that we also need to understand that

282
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:14,170
what happens, uh, in the case of indentation error, let's say if I go ahead and write, age is equal

283
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,890
to 32.

284
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,210
And if I write if age is greater than 30, okay.

285
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,320
And if I go ahead and execute it and let's say I don't use this indentation.

286
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,830
Instead I start from here and I go ahead and write print age.

287
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,750
So here clearly you will be getting an error saying that hey indentation error expected and uh indented

288
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,150
block after if statement on line two.

289
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,220
So this is how you will be able to understand it.

290
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,330
All I have to do is that start from this and automatically you'll be able to see the answer.

291
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,620
Okay.

292
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,500
Uh, this is important.

293
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,850
Uh, otherwise, uh, understand without indentation, things will not work out.

294
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,740
Even though you create classes, even though you create functions, whenever you write a block of codes

295
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,150
within some kind of blocks itself, like an if statement for loop or while loop.

296
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,790
So indentation is specifically required there.

297
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,640
You do not explicitly need to use brackets.

298
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,730
Now, uh, one more thing, one more syntax error, which usually people do.

299
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,150
Let's say I have defined a is equal to B and you know that B is not defined.

300
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,330
So if I go ahead and execute this this is also kind of syntax error.

301
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,580
Because name B is not defined over here.

302
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:18,760
Right.

303
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,970
So this basically becomes uh unknown variable.

304
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,480
Right.

305
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,670
So this is nothing but this is basically called as a name error.

306
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:28,270
Okay.

307
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,700
I'll be showing you as we go ahead.

308
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,450
Uh, with respect to exception handling and how do we handle all these things.

309
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,860
We'll be talking more about it.

310
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,310
Okay.

311
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,440
Now, uh, let me do one thing.

312
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:45,220
Uh, let me just show you one amazing example of indentation, some code example of indentations.

313
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:45,970
Okay.

314
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:52,450
And again, uh, after this session, also, I will be giving you a lot of, uh, quizzes, assignments,

315
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,430
practice, uh, sessions and all.

316
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,020
You just need to go ahead and do it.

317
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,470
Okay.

318
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,370
Practice it.

319
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,140
So here if I write if true.

320
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,580
So true is a kind of a boolean variable, I will be talking more about variables in our next session.

321
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,710
Let's say I go ahead and print.

322
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,480
This is my correct indentation right indentation.

323
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,050
So here uh this this basically becomes my statement.

324
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,650
And print is just to print anything in your output console.

325
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,100
Okay.

326
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,660
Now inside this true let's say I have another condition if false.

327
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,420
Now if I want to write any print statement inside this block, then I have to again do an indentation.

328
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,620
So here we go ahead and write.

329
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,980
Print this one print right.

330
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,150
This one print.

331
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,970
Why it will not print because by default it is true.

332
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,350
This is going to print.

333
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,570
It is going to check this condition.

334
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,550
It is going to come out of this particular condition.

335
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,000
Right.

336
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,370
And finally you'll be able to see that I'm printing one more thing over here saying that whether this

337
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,450
will print or not, you just think, okay, this will obviously print, right?

338
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,130
Because this is not getting executed.

339
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,420
We are not going inside this.

340
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,880
And finally, this print statement will execute.

341
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:03,280
Now, if I want to go outside the if clause, then this will be another print statement.

342
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,850
Right.

343
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,500
And I can basically say outside the if block.

344
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,020
So how many times print is going to uh, just pause the video and understand how many times the print

345
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,940
statement is going to execute it, right?

346
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:16,330
Three times.

347
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,670
So if I go ahead and execute it, you'll be able to see correct indentation.

348
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,250
This will print outside the if block okay.

349
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,920
So this is basically going to get printed right.

350
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,550
So these are some of the amazing examples of indentation okay.

351
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
Now uh let me do one thing.

352
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Let me show you one more thing.

353
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,370
Right.

354
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,490
Um, one is with respect to uh, correct variable assignment and, uh, type inference.

355
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,860
But before I go ahead and explain you more about this, this is some basics about syntax and semantics.

356
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,000
Uh, now, as we go ahead, uh, what all things we basically covered single line comments, multi line

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,920
comments, definition, syntax and semantics.

358
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,180
Basic syntax rules.

359
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,070
How do you define a variable?

360
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,000
What is Kansas?

361
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,370
Uh, case sensitive and all everything.

362
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,840
Uh, I've actually covered over here.

363
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,020
Right.

364
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:06,110
This actually gives you an idea about, uh, you know, the basic differences between syntax and semantics

365
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:06,710
also.

366
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,270
So I hope you like this particular video.

367
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:13,520
In the next video I am going to talk about, uh, variables, then data types, then operators.

368
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,030
Right.

369
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,530
So yes, this was it from my side.

370
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,970
I will see you all in the next video.

371
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,300
Thank you.
