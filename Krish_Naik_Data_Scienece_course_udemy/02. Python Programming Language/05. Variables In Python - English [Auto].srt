00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:00,710
Hello guys.

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,080
So we are going to continue the discussion with respect to Python.

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,840
And in this video we are going to discuss about variables.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,410
Okay.

5
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,970
Now what exactly is variables.

6
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:10,700
And uh here I've also given the entire video outline.

7
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,500
So we will first of all introduce uh like uh the topic is introduction to variables.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,200
Then we'll be seeing how we can declare and assign variables.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,150
Then we'll talk about the naming convention.

10
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,920
Then we'll understand variable type.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
We'll see type checking and conversion dynamic typing.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,220
And finally we'll be seeing a lot of practical examples and common errors okay.

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,730
So all these things will be specifically covered in this video okay.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,700
Now first of all as usual let's go with the definition.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,470
So variables are fundamental elements in programming used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated

16
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,310
in a program.

17
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:46,730
In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to them, and they do not need explicit declaration

18
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,290
to reserve memory space.

19
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,310
The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable.

20
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,940
Okay.

21
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,500
So, uh, the best way to give you an example is that let's say if I define a is equal to 100.

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,240
So this basically becomes the variable.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,130
And always remember guys, whenever you start a new notebook file always make sure to select the kernel

24
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:04,520
okay.

25
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,410
Now if I'm going to write a is equal to 100.

26
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:10,820
This basically means that I've created a variable a and I've assigned a value to 100.

27
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,270
Okay.

28
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,700
Now uh, obviously in my previous video I've also defined some basic variables and all, and I've assigned

29
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,470
some values, let's say string, numerical uh, integers, floating point, anything, any values you

30
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,790
can basically assign.

31
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,770
Uh, we'll be learning more about it.

32
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:34,370
Uh, so first of all let's go ahead and understanding about declaring, declaring and assigning variables.

33
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:34,850
Okay.

34
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,100
So here, uh, you'll be able to see that, uh, let's say I'm going to define age is equal to 32.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,530
I'm going to probably define height is equal to six feet or 6.1.

36
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,060
That is specifically my height.

37
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,110
So I'm writing it down.

38
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,700
So height is equal to 6.1.

39
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,690
Then let's say name is equal to my name I will go ahead and define crush.

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,730
Uh and then here you can also see that I can also define a boolean variable.

41
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,660
Let's say I will go ahead and define is underscore student okay.

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,670
I will also talk about naming convention.

43
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,100
Uh what is the best naming convention of defining a variable.

44
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,360
What are the good practices.

45
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
Everything I'll be discussing about.

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,890
So let's say I'm going to define a boolean variable as true right.

47
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:15,680
We'll learn more about the specific data types in my next video.

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,720
But here I'm just giving you an example okay.

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,040
So age is equal to 32.

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,970
This this is there.

51
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,950
And I have actually written it right now.

52
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,990
Let me quickly go ahead and print it.

53
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,330
And this is how we assign a variable right.

54
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,820
We are declaring a variable and we signing some values.

55
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,270
Right.

56
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,310
So now let me just go ahead and print printing the variables.

57
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,790
Right.

58
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,080
So here you can see.

59
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,830
So now first of all I'm going to print age right.

60
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:45,440
And this is where I will also show you how you can use uh different print, how you can uh, display

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,730
in your console in a different way.

62
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,800
So first of all, let's say I want to print age.

63
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,420
So age colon let's say I want to assign this age colon with some value over here.

64
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,250
So I will go ahead and define my variable age.

65
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,700
Right.

66
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,980
Similarly, if I go ahead and show you the next print statement here, I'm going to basically write

67
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,540
height okay.

68
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,050
And with respect to this particular height I am going to define another variable.

69
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's say this will basically be my height.

70
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,140
Another next thing that I'm going to print over here is my name.

71
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,060
And here you can probably see that I'm going to basically define my name.

72
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,040
And let me just go ahead and write comma.

73
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,780
And this will basically be my name.

74
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,260
Right.

75
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,610
So if I want to define all these things you here, you can see I'm displaying age is equal to 32.

76
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,990
Height is equal to 6.1.

77
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,010
Name is equal to crush.

78
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,540
That basically means see, when I'm printing I can also call this particular variable that I have actually

79
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:32,930
defined.

80
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,410
Okay.

81
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,780
So these are some of the ways uh again we will be discussing about more different boolean type, more

82
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,610
different data types as we go ahead.

83
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,190
And that is how we declare different different variables.

84
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,970
But just a basic idea for you with respect to the variable declaration.

85
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,480
Okay.

86
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:51,200
Now coming to the next one, which is basically called as naming convention.

87
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,790
And this is the most important one.

88
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,970
Like how should we name a variable right then for this you really need to know about the naming convention.

89
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,480
Some of the important points that I would like to mention over here, let's say uh, variables, uh,

90
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,110
name.

91
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:06,380
Right.

92
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:14,540
The variable name that we define right should be should be descriptive.

93
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:15,740
Okay.

94
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,550
Then.

95
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:24,650
Uh, the second point that I would like to mention, they must always start with a letter.

96
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:24,890
Okay.

97
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,360
So this is the second condition.

98
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,750
Or it can also start with an underscore okay.

99
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,170
Underscore like underscore uh this kind of underscore mark.

100
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:33,680
Right.

101
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:42,830
And uh it can contain letters numbers and underscore in between.

102
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:43,400
Right.

103
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,660
In between.

104
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,130
But always understand they must always start with a letter or underscore.

105
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,790
And it can contain letters numbers and underscores okay.

106
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,840
Within inside that.

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,260
Okay.

108
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,990
And uh, one more thing.

109
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:59,360
Very important point, which I have already mentioned.

110
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,340
Variables.

111
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,720
Names are.

112
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,560
Case sensitive.

113
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:05,670
Okay.

114
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,930
This also have defined it.

115
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,680
So these are some of the naming important naming convention with respect to the variables.

116
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:11,190
Okay.

117
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,590
Now let's see some kind of example over here.

118
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,970
So first of all I will just go ahead and write some valid variable name okay.

119
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,160
So valid variable names.

120
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,370
So first valid variable name I'm going to define it as first underscore name is equal to crush okay.

121
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,540
Uh last underscore name is equal to Nick.

122
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:30,840
Right.

123
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,170
So is this a good way of writing a variable.

124
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:34,620
Yes.

125
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,970
Does it start with a letter.

126
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,360
Yes.

127
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,560
It starts with a letter.

128
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,640
Does can it contain letter number or numbers or underscores.

129
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,540
Yes it can contain.

130
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,570
So here you can see I am having letters or underscore.

131
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,050
I can also put numbers in between but not in the starting right.

132
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,780
So this is a good way of defining a variable.

133
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,170
Okay.

134
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,050
So here uh this absolutely works fine.

135
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:02,700
Let me say show you some invalid variable name, invalid variable names okay.

136
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,640
So let's say that I define with a number.

137
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:05,910
Right.

138
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,430
And if I go ahead and define over here age is equal to 30.

139
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,790
See I'm getting an error saying that invalid decimal literal right.

140
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,260
So I cannot start with a letter.

141
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,790
So this is one way okay.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,280
The another way is that uh can I define something like this first dash name.

143
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,030
Right.

144
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,170
Can I define like this.

145
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,810
First dash name is equal to let's say crush.

146
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,490
Can I define like this.

147
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,480
Will I get an error.

148
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,720
So here you can see cannot assign to expression here.

149
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,410
Maybe you mean double equal to or instead of equal to.

150
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,030
So this is not being considered.

151
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,160
This symbol is also not being used.

152
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,730
Right.

153
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,110
Uh so obviously this is also an invalid variable name.

154
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,770
Right.

155
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:48,540
The third invalid variable name can I use at the rate and define a name variable.

156
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,050
Right.

157
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,180
So let me just go ahead and check it out.

158
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,430
So here I'll just go ahead and write crush.

159
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,540
Will I get an error.

160
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,950
It says invalid syntax.

161
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,540
Maybe you meant so and so right.

162
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,990
So this is also not a valid variable name.

163
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,090
It is an invalid variable name okay.

164
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,530
And already I have spoken about case sensitive right.

165
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,420
Case sensitivity right.

166
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,750
If I define name is equal to crush.

167
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,940
And let's say I have defined capital name is equal to Nick.

168
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,420
Right.

169
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,910
Both this are different right.

170
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:21,990
It is not same.

171
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,290
Right.

172
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,090
If I really want to compare can I compare like this num name double equal to capital name.

173
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,040
It'll be giving false right?

174
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,430
Yes.

175
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,000
The values.

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,500
If it is same it will give me true.

177
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,970
But in short you can see that these are different identifiers, right?

178
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,790
Later on I can do the comparison operation and I can do it right.

179
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,890
So obviously case sensitivity is also there.

180
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,340
Right.

181
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,360
So this was uh related to something related to the naming conventions.

182
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:45,900
Okay.

183
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,150
Now let me just go ahead and make you understand about some of the variable types.

184
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,690
Okay.

185
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,380
So uh, we will continue the writing the code here itself.

186
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:02,160
So let me just go ahead and write understanding variable types okay.

187
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,820
Now one thing you need to understand Python is dynamically typed okay.

188
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,370
Dynamically typed.

189
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,670
What does this mean?

190
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,490
This means the type of a variable.

191
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,340
Type of a variable is determined at runtime.

192
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,130
Determined at runtime.

193
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:25,670
Right.

194
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,980
So this is very much important okay.

195
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,270
And some of the important data types are like int float string and boolean.

196
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:32,720
Right.

197
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,690
So let's say if I write age is equal to 25 right.

198
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:40,100
So when I execute it during the runtime it will understand.

199
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,820
Hey fine.

200
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,260
Integer is basically getting assigned.

201
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,510
So age is an integer variable right.

202
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,920
And let's say that I will go ahead and define some more variables right.

203
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,850
Let's say height right I'm going to basically go ahead and define height.

204
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,590
Let's say I'm going to write 6.1.

205
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,740
So this this is nothing but it is integer.

206
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,960
This is nothing but this is float.

207
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,210
See how I'm also using the single line comments.

208
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,720
Right.

209
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,180
Let's say if I'm going to define my name.

210
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,620
So this will basically be Chris.

211
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,370
So this is what this is nothing but str the string.

212
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,950
And finally if I go ahead and define is underscore student.

213
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,170
This is basically my boolean variable right.

214
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,220
So boolean.

215
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,110
Uh sorry I will assign it as true.

216
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,390
So this basically becomes my boolean variable.

217
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,510
Now if I go ahead and print the type of any of this right like age.

218
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,100
So I'm going to basically get integer.

219
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,000
The class will be integer.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,720
During the runtime.

221
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,920
It is able to understand it.

222
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,780
If I go ahead and print what is the type of name I'm actually going to get string right.

223
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,970
So similarly you will be able to find out different different types like what classes it basically belongs

224
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,300
to.

225
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:41,780
Okay.

226
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,810
Now one more thing.

227
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,180
Right here I will discuss about one very important point and understand one thing guys.

228
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,860
Here I'll be showing some example.

229
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,410
But when I go ahead with more session, more different lessons as we go ahead, right.

230
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,240
I'll be reusing all these things.

231
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,280
Don't think that I'm just going to write for a single time over here, because this all things will

232
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,270
again get repeated.

233
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:05,750
Okay.

234
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,610
With all the different, different examples.

235
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,990
Now let me just go ahead and make you understand about type checking and conversion.

236
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,440
Okay.

237
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,360
Now type checking and conversion.

238
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,530
What does this basically mean.

239
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,430
Obviously type checking.

240
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,180
You have known right.

241
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,760
So if I go ahead and write type off height.

242
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,230
So that basically means I'm going to get the uh data type of this height variable.

243
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,440
Right.

244
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:28,040
So in short I'm actually getting float over here right now.

245
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,450
My question arises, can we convert one data type to the other data type.

246
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,350
Is it possible.

247
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,730
So let me just go and show you.

248
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,090
Let's say if I go ahead and write age is equal to 25 right now.

249
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:44,090
You know that if I go ahead and write print type of age, so what I'm actually going to get it is an

250
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,320
integer, right?

251
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,620
But now I am going to perform some type conversion.

252
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,060
Type conversion basically means I am going to convert this integer value into a string value.

253
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,450
Let's say.

254
00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:00,350
So if I go ahead and write age underscore str, and if I go and use this str function right str function

255
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,370
is what string right.

256
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,860
This is what is the class that I'm actually getting.

257
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,430
Now if I want to convert this age into string I can use this str.

258
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,590
And I can use this age variable over here right now if I go ahead and write print age.

259
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,610
Print age underscore str okay.

260
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,970
And after that I will just go ahead and write print type of age underscore str right.

261
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:26,240
So if I go ahead and execute it see initially it was int.

262
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,570
Later on uh when I printed this age underscore str here you can probably see that I'm getting 25 okay.

263
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,540
But the type of this particular value is string.

264
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,340
Right here you can see string.

265
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,600
So this this value from integer it has got converted into strings okay.

266
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,030
Now the question arises Krish.

267
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,490
Uh what are different types of type conversion.

268
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:47,630
Can I do okay.

269
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,610
Can can I do something like this.

270
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,420
Can I write.

271
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,820
Age is equal to in string like 25.

272
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,950
And can I convert this into int.

273
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,090
Let's see.

274
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:56,840
Right.

275
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,920
Let's see this.

276
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,210
So the answer is yes.

277
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,950
You are able to convert it right.

278
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,750
So if I go ahead and print uh the type of int of age.

279
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,850
Yes definitely you are able to convert it.

280
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,390
Right.

281
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,160
And here I'm just going to close it.

282
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,390
Yes the class is int.

283
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,790
This is fine but still I will just go ahead and use one more.

284
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,600
Some more examples.

285
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:26,450
Let's say if I go ahead and write my name is Krish right now do I, can I convert this into an integer?

286
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,190
The answer is no, right?

287
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,820
Because obviously Krish is a complete sentence, right?

288
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,590
If I talk about 25 in string manner, this is basically a numerical value itself, right?

289
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,370
So even though it is an A string I can convert this into an int type.

290
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,190
But over here this is my string complete string.

291
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,920
I cannot just convert this into an integer type or a float type.

292
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,660
So here you basically get an error saying that invalid literal for int with base ten Krish.

293
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,140
Right?

294
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,500
So this is the value that you are able to get it over here right.

295
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,300
Another example some more example.

296
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,010
Let's define some float value.

297
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,430
Right.

298
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:04,460
So let's say my uh my height is nothing but 6.1 okay.

299
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,530
Or let's say 6.0 or 6 point or 5.11 okay.

300
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,280
Something.

301
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,790
Okay.

302
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,170
Now if I.

303
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,430
Go ahead and see the type of height, what exactly it is.

304
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,580
It is nothing but float, right?

305
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,790
Can I convert this float into an integer?

306
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,110
The answer is yes.

307
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:29,300
So if I go ahead and write int and I do the type casting for this particular height variable, you'll

308
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,670
be able to see that I'm able to get five right.

309
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,890
That basically means it is just going to remove the decimal.

310
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,370
Right.

311
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,870
Can I do the opposite again?

312
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,200
Can I again type cast this from int to float again?

313
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,550
Yes I can.

314
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,250
And it is going to give my 5.0 right.

315
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,600
So 5.11.

316
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,450
Initially I converted this into an integer I got 5.0.

317
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,340
Then again sorry I got five.

318
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,410
And then again I converted that into float.

319
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,550
So I got 5.0.

320
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:57,950
So this is some example with respect to the conversion right type checking conversion.

321
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,520
So this is what I really want to show you over here okay.

322
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,890
Now let me do one thing.

323
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:10,100
Let me talk about one very important concept which is called as dynamic typing okay.

324
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,580
And this is probably the most amazing feature in Python okay.

325
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,670
Let's say I'm going to define a variable ten okay I'm going to define a variable ten okay.

326
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:23,660
Now let me just go ahead and write print var.

327
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:33,770
Where I'm going to print this var and I'm going to also print type of var okay type of var perfect.

328
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,510
So this initially is an integer.

329
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,580
Then obviously it should give ten.

330
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,540
It should display ten.

331
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,490
And it should say that hey it is an integer.

332
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:48,320
Now Python allows the type of a variable to change as the program executes.

333
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,590
Right.

334
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,450
So let me write down this particular command.

335
00:14:50,540 --> 00:15:04,640
Python allows the type of a variable to change to change as the program executes, right?

336
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,180
Amazing.

337
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,780
Right?

338
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,490
Now what does this basically mean?

339
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,750
Now I can go ahead and change the value of var and I can write hello.

340
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,230
Okay.

341
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:17,270
And let's say I'm going to print var comma type of var okay.

342
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,120
This time obviously you know what it will output will be string.

343
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,570
If you're not satisfied with this again you can change.

344
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:27,740
So as you keep on executing the code you can keep on changing it.

345
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,470
Let's say now this time I define it as a float variable.

346
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:36,290
Now if I go ahead and write print var okay var comma type of var.

347
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:41,180
So if I go ahead and execute this here, you'll be able to see that I'm able to get this right.

348
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,140
So see initially it was ten class int hello class str.

349
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,930
And finally 3.14 class is float.

350
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,190
So what is basically happening.

351
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,110
Python is allowing this type of a variable to change as the program gets executed.

352
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:54,530
Right.

353
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,090
So we can basically do this.

354
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:56,510
Okay.

355
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,470
Now uh, let's do one amazing thing.

356
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,440
Let's just create a simple, uh, application with whatever things we are specifically not.

357
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,920
Okay.

358
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,770
And before that, let me just talk about input.

359
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,010
Okay.

360
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,180
Now what exactly is input?

361
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,500
Let's say that, uh, a user wants to give some values, right.

362
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,910
Let's say age.

363
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,000
And I've told that hey, user, you give the value.

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,230
What is the age?

365
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,770
Okay.

366
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,120
What is the age.

367
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,800
So I, I am a user.

368
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,660
I want to probably give the value over here.

369
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:34,400
So if I use this right input function and if I print age over here see what will happen.

370
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,220
So once I execute this statement now see what will happen.

371
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,850
So here you can see uh a input box has got opened.

372
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,920
So here I'm just going to give my uh, age, let's say the age is 23 okay.

373
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,240
And I'm going to press enter.

374
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,490
So here you can see I'm printing the age now.

375
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,740
One very important thing to show you right.

376
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,560
What will be the type of this age okay.

377
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,420
So that basically means whenever I'm giving any input from this particular input box by using this input

378
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,330
function, what will be the type of it by default type.

379
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,400
So here I'm going to go ahead and write 23.

380
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,410
And here you can see it is a string type.

381
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,290
So let's say I want to probably get this particular input.

382
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,620
And then also convert this into an integer or float.

383
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,380
So I can again typecast this entire thing.

384
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,860
Right.

385
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:21,080
So now if I go ahead and execute this now let me just go ahead and write 23 and press enter.

386
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,420
So here you can see I'm getting class int right.

387
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:30,650
So this is uh one very important functionality for uh, uh, the entire uh input function over here.

388
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,700
And uh, this can be very handy and can be used in various places.

389
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,240
Okay.

390
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,680
So I hope, uh, you are able to execute this and, uh, you are able to understand this.

391
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,900
So I'm just going to show you one example again.

392
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,220
Now let us do one thing.

393
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,360
Let us simply create one simple calculator okay.

394
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,030
Now this simple calculator will be amazing.

395
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:55,070
So here you can, uh, just see that, uh, what this calculator is doing I'm giving two numbers.

396
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,370
Uh, again, I'm using this input, uh, number one.

397
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,790
Again.

398
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,650
Number two, then some.

399
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,490
I'm doing num plus num one plus num two difference num one minus num two.

400
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,510
And product is num one multiplied by num two num one divided by num two.

401
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:11,390
We'll discuss more about this operators as we go ahead.

402
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:11,840
And we are just.

403
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,010
Going to display all the some difference and all.

404
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,670
So let's go.

405
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,690
Execute it.

406
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,730
Let's say the first number is 56.

407
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,820
I'll go ahead and press enter again I've got my another cell.

408
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,760
Let's say I'm going to write 43 or 10 something and press enter.

409
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,800
So here you can see I'm able to see all the ounces like some difference product and quotient.

410
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,370
Right.

411
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,600
So yes.

412
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,850
Uh, this was uh, amazing.

413
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,500
This was I guess, you, you are able to understand many things about variables.

414
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,570
Uh, this was it from my side.

415
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,470
Uh, in the next video, I am going to probably discuss more about data types.

416
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,350
And then finally we'll also be discussing about operators.

417
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,670
What are the different different data types.

418
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,080
Also we need to discuss about.

419
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,550
So yes this was it for my side.

420
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,660
I will see you in the next video.

421
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:54,930
Thank you.
