1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:05,750
So guys, one of the most important question that I've been asked by many people who implement end to

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,230
end project, that is with respect to creating an environment.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,790
Now there are multiple ways in creating an environment, uh, for a project.

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,650
And it is always a good idea that you probably create a separate environment for every project because

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,090
you have a different set of dependencies and libraries that you need to install over there.

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:30,470
Now, considering this right, I usually in my YouTube channel I use Conda command to create, uh,

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,520
environment itself.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,060
Right.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,870
And many people do not have Anaconda installed, they just have Python installed.

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,510
So due to that they get some kind of error.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,110
Right.

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,640
You can also create an environment through this Python command which I'm going to show you.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:48,740
So again in this video what all things I'm actually going to cover, all the different ways how you

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,910
can probably create an environment and start your end to end project itself.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,740
So let me quickly go ahead and show you I'm going to show you three different ways.

16
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,260
I'll open my terminal.

17
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:00,890
Okay.

18
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:06,770
And the best thing is that you can use along with you can use as a Linux command.

19
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,710
Also you can use as in Windows Command Prompt also.

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,660
So let me just show you the first way.

21
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:17,360
The first way will be using python command right conda create command I usually show you.

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,600
But today I will show you all the three ways how you can actually do it.

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,540
So let me go ahead and write by using the python command.

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,110
So I will write p y t o h in python okay.

25
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:30,860
And then here I will go ahead and write minus m okay.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,300
And my command name that is v and v inside what folder.

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,510
Okay.

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,450
So here let's say my folder is why my e and v.

29
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,440
So once I do this this folder will automatically get created okay.

30
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,260
And by default a environment will be set up.

31
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,770
Now inside this particular environment, what kind of uh, Python version you specifically have for

32
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,040
that?

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,530
First of all, let's go ahead and activate it okay.

34
00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:00,560
Now to activate this, what I will do inside my me and V there will be include libraries, folders and

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,990
all inside script there is one activate file.

36
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,160
So I just need to go ahead and activate this to activate this particular environment.

37
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:16,310
So for that what I will do I will write my env slash scripts slash activate okay.

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,450
So once I write this and now here you can see that my environment is activated.

39
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:24,770
Now I can probably go ahead and install any kind of libraries that I specifically want.

40
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,780
Let's say pip install pandas.

41
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:34,310
If I do or pip install numpy, then automatically the numpy will get installed in this specific library.

42
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,790
Okay.

43
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,070
And later on, if you have many number of libraries you can basically create a requirement dot txt for

44
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,280
this.

45
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,490
The prerequisite is that you only need to have Python installed.

46
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,830
Now, which version of Python is probably getting installed over here that also you really need to check

47
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:49,910
by default.

48
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,060
Let's say in my Python environment right now I just shot right.

49
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,580
Let's let's go and see my Python version.

50
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:59,270
So let me go ahead and write Python version.

51
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,910
So inside my Python version oops.

52
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,940
You can see Python 3.8.5 is there.

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,330
Right.

54
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,780
So by default whenever I create an environment.

55
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,170
So this Python 3.85 only will get created.

56
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,720
Because in my system I have this specific thing installed.

57
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,410
Let's say I want to create with another Python version.

58
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,320
Then I need to upgrade my python package itself, right?

59
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,470
I need to probably make it to 3.1. 2 or 3 .1.2.

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,350
What I need to do is that just go to Google, okay?

61
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:32,780
And probably let's say I go to python.org and here I download the recent version.

62
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,710
Now automatically.

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,880
What will happen is that whenever I create an environment that through that way then I will get this

64
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,930
specific version.

65
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,790
So this is one way okay.

66
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,960
The another way.

67
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,240
So let me quickly I've activated it.

68
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,700
Now I will go ahead and deactivate it.

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,780
I will clear the screen.

70
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,180
So this is one environment that has got created.

71
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,290
Now there is also another way which we specifically use for Linux.

72
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,760
Uh Linux commands itself.

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,090
So first of all I will go ahead and install virtual envy.

74
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,840
So this virtual envy sorry I think it'll get an error.

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,500
So virtual envy this I will try to install.

76
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,410
So once I properly install virtual envy I'll show you how you can create a command an environment through

77
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,910
using virtual envy itself.

78
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,090
And that also you can also use it in PowerShell or Good Bash.

79
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,470
So in Virtual Envy I will go ahead and write virtual envy okay.

80
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,650
And after writing virtual envy, let me go and go ahead and write it minus pi P.

81
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,750
And then I will go ahead and write Python.

82
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,410
Okay.

83
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,500
Python the version I know that it is somewhere around three.

84
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,030
And this will basically be my virtual environment name virtual underscore envy.

85
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,390
So once I go ahead and execute it, you'll be able to see that.

86
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,720
Now inside this virtual envy is also getting created.

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,090
And inside this also you have a script folder.

88
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,730
So if you want to activate somewhere activate.

89
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,530
This will also be there right.

90
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,990
Activate file will be there to activate those commands.

91
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,600
So in order to activate it what I will do I will quickly go ahead and clear the screen and go ahead

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:04:59,840
and write.

93
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,410
A virtual envy.

94
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,830
I think the the folder name is virtual envy, I guess.

95
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,630
Let's see.

96
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,490
Virtual underscore envy.

97
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,730
Virtual underscore envy.

98
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:18,760
So slash scripts slash back slash activate.

99
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,390
So once I activate now here you can see I'm getting some error.

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,400
Let's see what is the file name.

101
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,750
Scripts.

102
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:32,680
Scripts uh slash I think the spelling is somewhere here itself.

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,830
Let's see I will go ahead and copy this path.

104
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,260
Okay.

105
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:45,650
Oops.

106
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,670
Let me just see.

107
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,900
Okay.

108
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,800
Activate.

109
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,250
Activate.

110
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,090
Activate.

111
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,820
I will copy the relative path.

112
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,900
I'll paste it over there.

113
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,530
I think it should be.

114
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,240
Now you can see that it has got, uh, it moves into this particular virtual environment.

115
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,910
Now, in order to deactivate, I will go ahead and deactivate.

116
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:05,390
Okay.

117
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,610
Now, this is the thing, right?

118
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,630
Uh, through this, what you really need to do is that whenever you upgrade your Python, you'll be

119
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:17,450
able to create that particular Python, uh, environment with that particular Python version in this

120
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,520
the third way, which is the most common way in which I also use is by using conda create.

121
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,970
For this you really need to have anaconda installed.

122
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:33,380
An anaconda is a better way, I feel, because here you will be able to, you know, make sure that

123
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,850
all the packages, all the environments are properly managed through the Anaconda environment.

124
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,670
You can actually see each and every packages that has got installed.

125
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,800
So you can also use this specifically.

126
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,220
And for this way you only have to write conda create minus p v and v.

127
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,020
Let's say v and v one.

128
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,740
And here I will give my python version with respect to anything that I want.

129
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,170
3.10 and dot and y.

130
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,740
Right.

131
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,560
So this command actually helps you to create an environment even though in the base you have different

132
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,340
Python version.

133
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:14,960
See right now you have python version python v okay I will write python dash dash v.

134
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,270
So here okay version okay Python 3.8.5.

135
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:25,100
Right now what I will do is that I will make sure that I create it through the conda.

136
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,710
So I will write conda create minus p v and v one python.

137
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:35,450
Let's say I want to go with higher version python double equal to 3.10.

138
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,080
Right.

139
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,050
And if I write w dash y then you can see that automatically my entire environment will get created.

140
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,410
Right.

141
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,080
So I still find this as an efficient way.

142
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,940
But again if you don't have Anaconda and whenever because many, many people are getting this kind of

143
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,590
errors when they are doing my project, because I only use Conda because that is much more efficient

144
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,050
when I compare it to Python, but it is not possible.

145
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,690
I'm not saying that it is impossible to create in other ways.

146
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,580
You can go with that.

147
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,380
So that is the reason I have shown you all the specific ways to go ahead, and you can create a virtual

148
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,240
environment based on your needs.

149
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,070
So I hope you like this particular video.

150
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,810
This was it for my side.

151
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,940
And this was the video about creating different ways of environment in your Python projects itself.

152
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,720
Uh, yes.

153
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,140
Go ahead and try it out and if you have any queries, please let me know in the comment section of this

154
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,650
particular video.
