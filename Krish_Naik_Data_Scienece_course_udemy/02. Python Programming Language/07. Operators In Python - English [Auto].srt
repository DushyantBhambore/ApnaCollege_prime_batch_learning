1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,780
So guys, we are going to continue the discussion with respect to our Python series and this video.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:07,090
We are going to deep dive into the operators.

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,430
Uh, and we'll see that how with the help of Python we will be able to perform different different operations.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,530
Now here is the entire video outline.

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,320
So first of all we will go ahead and see introduction to operators.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Then we'll see multiple arithmetic operators like addition subtraction, multiple multiplication, division

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,420
flow division modulus and exponential.

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:31,540
Along with this we'll see comparison operators like equal to not equal to, greater than less than uh

9
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,760
greater than or equal to, less than or equal to.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,500
And we'll perform various operations.

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,890
Along with this will also be seeing logical operators like and or not.

12
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,360
And then will will be like all these things will be shown along with the practical examples.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,930
Right.

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,430
So let me just go ahead.

15
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,600
First of all, if you don't know about operators, guys, any kind of math, arithmetic operation or

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,440
logical operation can be probably performed with this kind of operators.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:53,770
Okay.

18
00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:00,220
And uh, obviously when we write any Python code, we definitely require a lot of, uh, operations,

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,080
uh, probably to develop our projects and.

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,740
All right, so quickly, let me just go ahead and create my code cell.

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,680
And here, uh, I will show you one shortcut.

22
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,010
You just press escape and press A automatically.

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,360
Cells will get appended.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,870
Right.

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,370
So first of all, uh, we are going to go ahead with arithmetic operations.

26
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,030
Right.

27
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,820
And uh, here with respect to the arithmetic operations, uh, let me just go ahead and create some

28
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,470
variables like a is equal to ten.

29
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,300
Uh, oops.

30
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,080
So I will go ahead and write okay.

31
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,040
This is getting added.

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,480
We'll discuss about all these things.

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,230
No worries.

34
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,600
So a is equal to ten okay.

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,230
And let's say I'm going to write B is equal to 15.

36
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,310
If I want to perform any kind of operations over here.

37
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:45,580
Right.

38
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,400
Let's say I want to perform a basic arithmetic operation.

39
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,300
I will go ahead and write.

40
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,190
Result is equal to a plus B.

41
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,190
So this is a addition operation that we specifically do.

42
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:58,600
And here I can go ahead and print my result right a simple addition operation.

43
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,690
So here my answer is 15 right.

44
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:10,450
Similarly what I can actually do is that again so this will basically be my add add result okay.

45
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,280
Similarly we can go ahead and create our subtraction result which will be nothing but a minus b.

46
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,320
Then, uh, along with this, we can go ahead and do our multiplication result, right?

47
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,870
Which will be nothing but A multiplied by B.

48
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,710
Uh, this is what we specifically get with respect to the multiplication operation.

49
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,310
Uh, along with multiple operation, we also have a division operation.

50
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,570
So let me just go ahead and write.

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,040
My division underscore result is equal to a divided by B.

52
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:38,580
Okay.

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,480
Uh and then we will also be having flow division.

54
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,390
We'll discuss what is the difference between flow division also.

55
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,740
So here you can see floor underscore div underscore results okay.

56
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,170
And here you can see I have to just use a double slash like it's not divided.

57
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,670
It's double divided by b okay.

58
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,810
So we'll discuss about this why exactly we use this flow division okay.

59
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,200
So this is my uh addition operation.

60
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:07,860
This is my subtraction operation.

61
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,260
Sub subtraction.

62
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,870
Operation, and the next one is my multiplication operation.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,650
And this is by division operation.

64
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,270
And this is my flow division.

65
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,160
We'll understand everything over here.

66
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,940
Don't worry.

67
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:26,750
Uh.

68
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,100
Normal operation.

69
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,150
I think you know it, right?

70
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,260
It's basic maths.

71
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,070
Then.

72
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,460
Uh, you also have, which is called as modulus operation.

73
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:41,210
Okay, so here I'm going to basically go ahead and write modulus underscore result is equal to a modulus

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,570
b.

75
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,250
So we'll discuss about this.

76
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,950
So this is exactly my modulus results.

77
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,230
Or here I can write a modulus operation okay.

78
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,020
And then finally you'll also be able to see that I will also use an exponential operation.

79
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:03,650
And here I can go ahead and write exponential underscore result which will be nothing but a to the power

80
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,310
to the power.

81
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,180
We basically say like we use this two star to the power of B okay, so this is basically my exponential

82
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,130
of operation okay.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,630
Perfect.

84
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,880
Now let's go ahead and print this result.

85
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,980
So here we have this.

86
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,560
Then again I will go ahead and write print.

87
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,530
Then again I will go ahead and write print.

88
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,500
I'll copy this print multiple times because I need to display this results together okay.

89
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,820
So now uh, let me just go ahead and write the subtract result.

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,570
Uh, let me go ahead and oops, just a second.

91
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,650
Multiple results.

92
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,870
So I will go ahead and paste it over here.

93
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,210
Then we have our div result.

94
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,950
We'll paste it over here.

95
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,200
Then we have our modulus result.

96
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,490
We'll paste it over here.

97
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,530
Then we have our exponential results.

98
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,540
We'll paste it over here okay.

99
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,960
Um one flow division result is pending.

100
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,090
So let me just go ahead and write it over here.

101
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,550
Print and I'll paste it over here.

102
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,650
So here you can see addition is 15.

103
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,910
Subtraction is five.

104
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,470
Multiplication is 50.

105
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,150
Division is 2.0.

106
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,970
And flow division result is nothing but two.

107
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,300
Right.

108
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,730
We will discuss about both of them by 2.0 and two.

109
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,140
Then you have modulus.

110
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:15,650
Operation.

111
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,550
Modulus basically means that it will try to just give you the remainder right.

112
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,990
So here you can see ten divided by five is uh like the remainder is zero.

113
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,750
So that is the reason you will be able to see zero is over here.

114
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,570
And when we do a to the power of B right, ten to the power of five, we are actually going to get this

115
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,470
value right.

116
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:33,920
Now.

117
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,260
Let's discuss more about this two okay.

118
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,460
This two operation.

119
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:42,710
Let's say that I want to uh, divide a number like ten divided by five.

120
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:49,580
So I will be able to get two if I go ahead and write, let's say I will go ahead and write 21 divided

121
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,030
by five.

122
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,290
And obviously, you know the result.

123
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,190
It is 4.2.

124
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,700
Right.

125
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,710
But if I use flow division then what will happen is that I will get the answer as four.

126
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,470
So whatever will be the flow value, right.

127
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,980
The lowest value, it will just remove the decimal and it will give you the output.

128
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,460
Okay.

129
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,320
So this is a basic example.

130
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,270
Now you can perform various operations.

131
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,570
Uh, and uh we will see I'll try to create a calculator for you.

132
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,160
And over here only I will show you that particular project also right as we go ahead.

133
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,120
Perfect.

134
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,240
Uh, now uh, the next step we are going to probably discuss about is comparison operators.

135
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,020
Okay.

136
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,930
So let me just go ahead and write it down and basically write it down as comparison operators.

137
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,010
So guys now let's go ahead and see some of the comparison operators.

138
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,050
Uh, now first of all uh we will go ahead with double equal to okay.

139
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,600
So we will be using double equal to.

140
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:47,300
Now let's say that uh, I will go ahead and create a result or let me just go ahead and define a variable

141
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,910
called as a is equal to ten okay.

142
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,650
And b is equal to ten.

143
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,610
Now if I want to probably compare this operators right.

144
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,610
What I can actually do I can go ahead and write my result.

145
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,400
And let me just go ahead and simply use a tuple.

146
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,200
I will talk about this brackets and just let me write it like a double equal to b.

147
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,750
Or if I don't even want to write like this, just go ahead and write a double equal to B, right?

148
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,480
If I execute it, I will be able to get true over here.

149
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,790
So this is nothing, but it is a more of a equal to comparison, where it will be comparing between

150
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,460
two identifiers and what value it has.

151
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:22,820
Right.

152
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,320
The, the it basically compares the value that is present within this particular data type.

153
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,740
Okay.

154
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,350
Then uh this is equal to operator.

155
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,080
So here I'm let me go ahead and write equal to operator.

156
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,680
And you can apply it in on various different data types.

157
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,490
Let's say I have str one, my string one I have like crush okay.

158
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,360
And str two I have crush right.

159
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,250
Same same string right.

160
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,900
So capital crush and crush.

161
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,930
Now if I go ahead and write str one double equal to str two, then here you will be able to see I'm

162
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,070
getting true right.

163
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,430
Let's say if I use a small k okay.

164
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,140
Then you can see that I'm getting a false.

165
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,380
So this comparison is also with respect to case sensitive right.

166
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,460
So whatever data is present with respect to this it is just going to compare it okay.

167
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,130
So this is uh some type of operations, uh, the next comparison operation that we are going to discuss

168
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,810
is nothing but not equal to.

169
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,500
Okay.

170
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,270
So not equal to which is denoted by this exclamation not equal to.

171
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:28,100
Now if I go ahead and just write str one is not equal to str two.

172
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:34,160
So obviously based on this comparison you can say that this is exactly false because both of the strings

173
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,610
are true.

174
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:34,970
Right.

175
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,950
So that is the reason it is coming as false.

176
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,980
Let's say if I go ahead and define again my string one and string two, let's say I go ahead and define

177
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,210
it as string three.

178
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,150
Uh string three.

179
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,640
And then this will basically be my string four.

180
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,260
And now let me make this as a small character okay.

181
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,630
And let me go ahead and write s three str three is not equal to str four.

182
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,970
Now it should probably give me a true value.

183
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,210
Why.

184
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,910
Because both of them are not equal right.

185
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,020
So this was another operation that is not equal to okay.

186
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,920
Now coming to the next one uh, which is basically called as greater than.

187
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,580
So this.

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,550
This will basically be greater than.

189
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,860
So this is again a comparison operation, uh, which we can actually use let's say, and this greater

190
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,120
than operation, let's say I have a value like 45 is equal to 45.

191
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,250
Or let me just go ahead and one number one, uh, 45, number two is 55.

192
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,720
Now, if I go ahead and write, number one is greater than, uh, number two.

193
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,140
Right.

194
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,620
So the answer may be false because number one is obviously small over here.

195
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,920
So here you can probably see that I'm actually getting false.

196
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,370
Right.

197
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,120
So this is uh one example of greater than operation.

198
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,470
And uh similarly if greater than is there then obviously less than should also be there.

199
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:58,930
So less than operation which is denoted by less greater than operation is basically denoted by this

200
00:09:58,930 --> 00:09:59,470
okay.

201
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:02,020
Now in this case if I want to execute less than.

202
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,950
So again if I go ahead and execute num one is less than num two.

203
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,580
So here you'll be able to see that I'm able to get true right.

204
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,050
You can also print this result.

205
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,460
At the end of the day I'm actually going to get a boolean value itself because this is a comparison

206
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,090
operation.

207
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,560
And with respect to all the comparison operation we are either going to get true or false.

208
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,010
Okay.

209
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,840
Now uh, this is fine.

210
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,820
Uh, like less than is there greater than is there?

211
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,850
Now obviously you also have something called as greater than or equal to.

212
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,090
Right.

213
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:34,150
So let me just go ahead and write greater than or equal to right.

214
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,290
So here, uh, let me just go ahead and show you once more, one more example.

215
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:41,980
Let's say that, um, um, I have a number one.

216
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,470
Number one is equal to 45 and number two is equal to 45.

217
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:47,980
Okay.

218
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:57,970
Uh, now if I go ahead and put this condition number one is greater than or equal to number two.

219
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,660
So I'm basically going to get the answer right over here as true.

220
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,300
Because obviously this is equal.

221
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,700
At least one of the condition is basically getting true.

222
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,060
Right.

223
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,150
So if I go ahead and print it you'll be able to see this right now here you can actually see that yes,

224
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,110
everything is working fine.

225
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,100
And I'm able to get true.

226
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,220
Now.

227
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:20,170
Similarly there is one more comparison operation which is nothing but less than or equal to.

228
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,070
Now, in this particular case, if I apply the condition less than or equal to two, again, I'm going

229
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,340
to get true because 45 is equal to 45.

230
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,030
So one of the condition is getting matched less than or equal to right.

231
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:36,490
If I go ahead and probably, uh, let's say in 40 number one, I go ahead and write 44.

232
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,660
Then also it is going to be true because, uh, this condition is getting matched because number one

233
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,920
is less than number two.

234
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,310
Right.

235
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,800
So over here, this is another one operation.

236
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,340
Right.

237
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:50,230
So just you got an idea about various comparison operation, uh, that we have actually done.

238
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,820
Now let me do one more thing.

239
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:57,430
Uh, let me just go ahead and, uh, talk about logical operators.

240
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:57,730
Okay.

241
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:04,360
So here I'm going to basically create a field and let's say I'm going to write logical operators.

242
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,870
Right.

243
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,990
So one is that we have discussed about comparison operator.

244
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,660
So let me make a cell over here so that for your reference purpose also it becomes easy right?

245
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,760
So for cell compare is an operators okay.

246
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,750
Done.

247
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,410
Perfect.

248
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,560
So comparison operators and here you have all the things right.

249
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,960
And now we are going to discuss about logical operators.

250
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:34,000
Now logical operators basically means the 311 is and one is uh not okay.

251
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,270
And one is or right.

252
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,900
So most common operation in logical operator is something like this.

253
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,180
Now let me talk about this right.

254
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,540
In the case of and you know, and if you know about digital logic gates, I hope in college at least

255
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:56,110
some idea you have about it in case of and when both A and B right are true, then only you will be

256
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:59,650
able to get the output as true, otherwise it will be completely false.

257
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,790
What do I mean by that?

258
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,560
Let's say I have two boolean variable.

259
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,700
One is x.

260
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,250
Let's say it is true right now.

261
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:13,540
In this particular case, if my y is also true right now, if I go ahead and write okay, let's say

262
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:21,040
that I go ahead and create my result and let me go ahead and write it as X and C and operation.

263
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:30,880
We have to use Y right now if I go ahead and print my result, if I go ahead and print my result, you'll

264
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,530
be able to see that I'm able to get true.

265
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,130
Right.

266
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,750
Because both of them are true.

267
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,260
Right.

268
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:41,740
But in this particular case, if I just copy this and paste it over here and this case now let me say

269
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:46,990
that if y is false, then if I go ahead and execute it, it's going to come false, right?

270
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:53,290
Even though this may be true and this may be false, then also I am able to get false.

271
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,200
So in the case of and operation right.

272
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,970
Always you need to make sure that uh whenever both the variable will be boolean true.

273
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,770
Then only your output will be true, right?

274
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,180
In the case of an operation.

275
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,450
Now let's go ahead and understand about or operation.

276
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,310
Now in the case of our operation, uh, only in the case of.

277
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:20,340
Only in the case when x and y are false, x and y are false.

278
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,480
Then only we are going to get the output as false.

279
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,570
Are the remaining all the time.

280
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,630
If I keep it as true or false or true?

281
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,290
True.

282
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,250
Uh, okay.

283
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:32,670
Uh, sorry.

284
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,060
This is.

285
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,360
And.

286
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:33,870
Right.

287
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,470
Okay.

288
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,860
Or.

289
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:40,740
Now, any time you'll be able to see whenever I keep x, either one of them is true or both of them

290
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,900
is true, I'm always going to get the output as true.

291
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:47,010
Otherwise, if both of them are false, I'm always going to get the output as false.

292
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,270
So this is the most important thing with respect to the Or operation, right?

293
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,660
And finally you'll be able to see that I also have another operation which is called as not and not

294
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,990
operation is nothing, but it is the reverse.

295
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,570
It is a just a reverse of a boolean variable.

296
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:03,930
Right?

297
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,460
What do I mean by that?

298
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,040
Let's say I have x is equal to true.

299
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:08,790
Right?

300
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:14,550
And if I go ahead and write not of x then what I'm able to get see inverse of this x.

301
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:14,850
Right.

302
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,250
So here I'm able to get false right.

303
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,140
So not is nothing.

304
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,540
But it is an inverse of any boolean variable.

305
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:27,390
So if this boolean variable is false then if I go ahead and write not of x then I'm actually able to

306
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,800
see that I'll be getting true.

307
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:29,340
Right.

308
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,840
So here uh, we have discussed various comparison logical operators.

309
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,830
Uh, again it will be important for various arithmetic operations as such.

310
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:44,880
One uh, good code example arithmetic or uh simple calculator will be designing and you can probably

311
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,500
check out this code okay.

312
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,090
So here you can see I'm giving float enter first number second number.

313
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:55,980
And you are performing addition subtraction multiplication float division modulus exponentiation.

314
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,240
And here you are displaying it.

315
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,830
So let's go ahead and execute this.

316
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:04,290
So if I go ahead and write uh 12 and execute it for execute it.

317
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,300
So here is what is my output.

318
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,750
Right.

319
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:10,890
So I hope uh you were able to understand regarding operators.

320
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,750
Uh, this was it from my side.

321
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,620
Uh, yeah.

322
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,050
Uh, I will see you all in the next video.

323
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,560
Thank you.

324
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:16,950
Take care.
